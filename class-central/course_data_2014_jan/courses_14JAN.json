In the past decade, machine learning has given us\n    self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search,\n    and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning\n    is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without\n    knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress\n    towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective\n    machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting\n    them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only\n    the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical\n    know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new\n    problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices\n    in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining,\n    and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning\n    (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels,\n    neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality\n    reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in\n    machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning\n    and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications,\n    so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building\n    smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam),\n    computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other\n    areas.",

They create passwords, follow security protocols, and share information that can maintain or destroy the security of a system. However, many secure systems are designed with little to no attention paid to people's cognitive abilities, workflow, or tasks. As a result, people find ways around the security obstacles that get in the way of their work.This course focuses on how to design and build secure systems with a human-centric focus. We will look at basic principles of human-computer interaction, including the basics of humans' cognitive abilities, principles of usability, design techniques, and evaluation methods. We will then apply these insights to the design of secure systems with the goal of developing security measures that respect human performance and their goals within a system.Through hands-on exercises designing, building, evaluating, and critiquing systems, students will learn how to integrate usability into secure software.

Latest hardware and software trends led to the development of a new revolutionary database technology that enables flexible and lightning-fast analysis of massive amounts of enterprise data. The basic concepts and design principles of this technology are explained in detail. Beyond that, the implications of the underlying design principles for future enterprise applications and their development are discussed. The course will explain in detail the differences and advantages of an in-memory column-oriented database in contrast to traditional row-oriented disk-based storages. The following topics are covered (among others):Requirements for Modern Enterprise Computing, Enterprise Application CharacteristicsHardware Trends, Columnar Storage vs. Row StorageDictionary Encoding, CompressionScans, Selects, Deletes, Inserts, UpdatesIndices, JoinsApplicationsSyllabusWeek 1:The first week will give you an understanding of origins of enterprise computing. It is vital to know the historic development which lead to the emergence of current hardware as we know it now in order to understand the decisions made in the past. Many characteristics of current applications, like materialized aggregates and a reduction of detail in the stored information, have their roots in the past. While these measures were helpful in former systems, they form an obstacle which has to be overcome now in order to allow for new, dynamic applications.Week 2:Within the second week, the differences between a horizontal, row oriented layout and a columnar layout are discussed. Concepts like compression and partitioning are introduced. Based on that, you will get an explanation of the internal steps performed inside the database to carry out the fundamental relational operations insert, update and delete.

        "desc": "The Web has become an object of our daily life and the amount of information in the web is ever growing. Besides plain texts, especially multimedia information such as graphics, audio or video have become a predominant part of the web's information traffic. But, how can we find useful information within this huge information space? Traditional search engines will reach the limits of their power, when it comes to understanding information content. The Semantic Web is an extension of the traditional web in the sense that information in the form of natural language text in the web will be complemented by its explicit semantics based on a formal knowledge representation. Thus, the meaning of information expressed in natural language can be accessed in an automated way and interpreted correctly, i.e. it can be understood by machines.Semantic Web technologies enable the explicit representation of knowledge and its further processing to deduce new knowledge from implicitly hidden knowledge. Thus, information access and information search will be more precise and more complete compared to today's traditional information retrieval technology. Previously heterogeneous data can be mapped and combined based on common knowledge representation and schemata easily extended in a dynamic way.In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of Semantic Web technologies. You will learn how to represent knowledge and how to access and benefit from semantic data on the Web.SyllabusWeek 1:Introduction to the Semantic WebWeek 2:Identifying Things with URI and RDFWeek 3:Querying RDF(S) with SPARQLExcursus:Semantic (Meta) Data and the WebWeek 4:Knowledge Representation IWeek 5:Knowledge Representation IIWeek 6:Applications in the Web of DataFinal Exams:Final Exams",

The course includes video lectures and demos with in-video quizzes to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, a wide variety of automatically-checked interactive programming exercises, midterm and final exams, a discussion forum, optional additional exercises with solutions, and pointers to readings and resources. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the curriculum draws from Stanford's popular Introduction to Databases course.WHY LEARN ABOUT DATABASESDatabases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge fraction of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.PREREQUISITES:The course does not assume prior knowledge of any specific topics, however a solid computer science foundation -- a reasonable amount of programming, as well as knowledge of basic computer science theory -- will make the material more accessible.

Developers and the software industry are used to applications becoming faster by merely exchanging the underlying hardware. However, since the beginning of the century it has become apparent that this approach no longer works.Moore's law about the ever-increasing number of transistors per chip is still valid, but power consumption, thermal management and memory latency issues are making make serial code acceleration increasingly harder. Instead, hardware vendors now use additional transistors for multiple processing elements (&lsquo;cores&rsquo;) per processor chip and deeper memory hierarchies. Modern hardware has the capability to transform any desktop, server, or even mobile system into some kind of parallel computer. This makes parallel programming the new default for application development. The exploitation of any additional horsepower from hardware is now in the responsibility of the software.The openHPI online course &ldquo;Parallel Programming Concepts&rdquo; presents relevant theoretical and practical foundations for parallel programming. We show crucial theoretical ideas such as semaphores and actors, the architecture of modern parallel hardware, different programming models such as task parallelism, message passing and functional programming, and several patterns and best practices.The course is suitable for all participants who are interested in getting a broader overview of parallelism, especially beyond the usage of multiple threads.

And more importantly - you will learn how to harness the power of&nbsp;App Engine&nbsp;- Platform as a Service, run by Google, so you can focus on your application's features, not on managing infrastructure that runs your app. Let Google run and scale the infrastructure and do what you do best - write code!However, to use App Engine effectively, you have to learn how it works, and this is exactly what this course will teach! You will also learn the best practices of using&nbsp;Cloud Endpoints&nbsp;that allow you to easily create RESTful services and make them accessible to iOS, Android and Javascript clients. They allow you to automatically generate client libraries to make wiring up the frontend easy. And there are some nifty built-in features, like denial-of-service protection and OAuth 2.0 support.Why Take This Course?Cloud computing is one of the fastest growing fields right now. And no wonder - it provides an easy and affordable way to run your applications. However, the traditional way of hosting and scaling applications on Virtual Machines in the Cloud comes with a cost - even if the infrastructure is virtual, you still have to manage it - do load balancing, bring instances up and down, take care of patching your software and in general spend a lot of your time and resources on just the infrastructure.Google is one of the pioneers in the business of scaling, and now you can use their infrastructure, and let them do all the scaling work so that you can focus on the unique features you app provides.ProjectThere will be an overarching project throughout the course, starting from Lesson 2. You will develop an application for organising conferences, similar to sites like meetup.com or eventbrite.com. We have provided the frontend of the app, and all your effort will go into making the backend.And because you will ",

Besides plain texts, especially multimedia information such as graphics, audio or video have become a predominant part of the web's information traffic. But, how can we find useful information within this huge information space? How can we make use of the knowledge contained in those web documents? Traditional search engines for example will reach the limits of their power, when it comes to understanding information content. The Semantic Web is an extension of the traditional web in the sense that information in the form of natural language text in the web will be complemented by its explicit semantics based on a formal knowledge representation. Thus, the meaning of information expressed in natural language can be accessed in an automated way and interpreted correctly, i.e. it can be &lsquo;understood&rsquo; by machines.Semantic Web technologies enable the explicit representation of knowledge and its further processing to deduce new knowledge from implicitly hidden knowledge. Thus, information access and information search will be more precise and more complete compared to today's traditional information retrieval technology. Previously heterogeneous data can be mapped and combined based on common knowledge representation and schemata easily extended in a dynamic way.In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of Semantic Web technologies and how they are applied for knowledge representation in the World Wide Web. You will learn how to represent knowledge with ontologies and how to access and benefit from semantic data on the Web.

Usually HTML and CSS is taught with a focus on language syntax. But knowing syntax alone does not enable you to create a webpage from a design. You need to know where to start and how to approach the task, in other words - you need to learn how to think like a front-end developer.In this course you will learn how to convert digital design mockups into static web pages. We will teach you how to approach page layout, how to break down a design mockup into page elements, and how to implement that in HTML and CSS.You will also learn about responsive design techniques, which are increasingly important in a world where mobile devices and TV screens are used more and more often to look for information and entertainment.Why Take This Course?Front-end Web Developers must have a fundamental understanding of HTML and CSS which we&rsquo;ll accomplish in this course by converting digital design mockups into static web pages.

Besides plain texts, especially multimedia information such as graphics, audio or video have become a predominant part of the web's information traffic. But, how can we find useful information within this huge information space? Traditional search engines will reach the limits of their power, when it comes to understanding information content. The Semantic Web is an extension of the traditional web in the sense that information in the form of natural language text in the web will be complemented by its explicit semantics based on a formal knowledge representation. Thus, the meaning of information expressed in natural language can be accessed in an automated way and interpreted correctly, i.e. it can be understood by machines.Semantic Web technologies enable the explicit representation of knowledge and its further processing to deduce new knowledge from implicitly hidden knowledge. Thus, information access and information search will be more precise and more complete compared to today's traditional information retrieval technology. Previously heterogeneous data can be mapped and combined based on common knowledge representation and schemata easily extended in a dynamic way.In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of Semantic Web technologies. You will learn how to represent knowledge and how to access and benefit from semantic data on the Web.SyllabusWeek 1:Introduction to the Semantic WebWeek 2:Identifying Things with URI and RDFWeek 3:Querying RDF(S) with SPARQLExcursus:Semantic (Meta) Data and the WebWeek 4:Knowledge Representation IWeek 5:Knowledge Representation IIWeek 6:Applications in the Web of DataFinal Exams:Final Exams",

Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the curriculum draws from Stanford's popular Introduction to Databases course.WHY LEARN ABOUT DATABASESDatabases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge fraction of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.PREREQUISITES:The course does not assume prior knowledge of any specific topics, however a solid computer science foundation -- a reasonable amount of programming, as well as knowledge of basic computer science theory -- will make the material more accessible.

Developers and the software industry are used to applications becoming faster by merely exchanging the underlying hardware. However, since the beginning of the century it has become apparent that this approach no longer works.Moore's law about the ever-increasing number of transistors per chip is still valid, but power consumption, thermal management and memory latency issues are making make serial code acceleration increasingly harder. Instead, hardware vendors now use additional transistors for multiple processing elements (&lsquo;cores&rsquo;) per processor chip and deeper memory hierarchies. Modern hardware has the capability to transform any desktop, server, or even mobile system into some kind of parallel computer. This makes parallel programming the new default for application development. The exploitation of any additional horsepower from hardware is now in the responsibility of the software.The openHPI online course &ldquo;Parallel Programming Concepts&rdquo; presents relevant theoretical and practical foundations for parallel programming. We show crucial theoretical ideas such as semaphores and actors, the architecture of modern parallel hardware, different programming models such as task parallelism, message passing and functional programming, and several patterns and best practices.The course is suitable for all participants who are interested in getting a broader overview of parallelism, especially beyond the usage of multiple threads.

And more importantly - you will learn how to harness the power of&nbsp;App Engine&nbsp;- Platform as a Service, run by Google, so you can focus on your application's features, not on managing infrastructure that runs your app. Let Google run and scale the infrastructure and do what you do best - write code!However, to use App Engine effectively, you have to learn how it works, and this is exactly what this course will teach! You will also learn the best practices of using&nbsp;Cloud Endpoints&nbsp;that allow you to easily create RESTful services and make them accessible to iOS, Android and Javascript clients. They allow you to automatically generate client libraries to make wiring up the frontend easy. And there are some nifty built-in features, like denial-of-service protection and OAuth 2.0 support.Why Take This Course?Cloud computing is one of the fastest growing fields right now. And no wonder - it provides an easy and affordable way to run your applications. However, the traditional way of hosting and scaling applications on Virtual Machines in the Cloud comes with a cost - even if the infrastructure is virtual, you still have to manage it - do load balancing, bring instances up and down, take care of patching your software and in general spend a lot of your time and resources on just the infrastructure.Google is one of the pioneers in the business of scaling, and now you can use their infrastructure, and let them do all the scaling work so that you can focus on the unique features you app provides.ProjectThere will be an overarching project throughout the course, starting from Lesson 2. You will develop an application for organising conferences, similar to sites like meetup.com or eventbrite.com. We have provided the frontend of the app, and all your effort will go into making the backend.And because you will ",

Besides plain texts, especially multimedia information such as graphics, audio or video have become a predominant part of the web's information traffic. But, how can we find useful information within this huge information space? How can we make use of the knowledge contained in those web documents? Traditional search engines for example will reach the limits of their power, when it comes to understanding information content. The Semantic Web is an extension of the traditional web in the sense that information in the form of natural language text in the web will be complemented by its explicit semantics based on a formal knowledge representation. Thus, the meaning of information expressed in natural language can be accessed in an automated way and interpreted correctly, i.e. it can be &lsquo;understood&rsquo; by machines.Semantic Web technologies enable the explicit representation of knowledge and its further processing to deduce new knowledge from implicitly hidden knowledge. Thus, information access and information search will be more precise and more complete compared to today's traditional information retrieval technology. Previously heterogeneous data can be mapped and combined based on common knowledge representation and schemata easily extended in a dynamic way.In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of Semantic Web technologies and how they are applied for knowledge representation in the World Wide Web. You will learn how to represent knowledge with ontologies and how to access and benefit from semantic data on the Web.

Usually HTML and CSS is taught with a focus on language syntax. But knowing syntax alone does not enable you to create a webpage from a design. You need to know where to start and how to approach the task, in other words - you need to learn how to think like a front-end developer.In this course you will learn how to convert digital design mockups into static web pages. We will teach you how to approach page layout, how to break down a design mockup into page elements, and how to implement that in HTML and CSS.You will also learn about responsive design techniques, which are increasingly important in a world where mobile devices and TV screens are used more and more often to look for information and entertainment.Why Take This Course?Front-end Web Developers must have a fundamental understanding of HTML and CSS which we&rsquo;ll accomplish in this course by converting digital design mockups into static web pages.

Software is increasingly the vehicle that drives our economy and our personal lives. But software\u2019s pervasiveness, and its importance, make it a target: at the root of many security compromises is vulnerable software.In this course we will look at how to build software that is secure.To start, we must know what we are up against. As such, we will examine the most prevalent software design and implementation defects.&nbsp;We will examine vulnerabilities like buffer overruns and use-after-frees that are present in programs written in low-level programming languages like C and C++, and see how these vulnerabilities can be exploited by a clever attacker. We will also look attacks on applications that are part of the worldwide web -- attacks with names like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and session hijacking. We will also mention side-channel attacks (such as those based on the size of messages or the time taken to process a request), attacks on the human user (like phishing), and failures of design (like the use of insecure defaults). Examples of these attacks will be taken from the headlines.Having examined these defects and their role in security compromises, we will look at how to prevent them entirely, or mitigate their effects, by improving the software's design and implementation. We will see that security must appear at all phases in the development lifecycle, including requirements development, system design, implementation, and testing/validation.Finally, we will look at state-of-the-art tools and techniques for testing and otherwise verifying that software is secure.

Anyone can write a program; this course teaches to write good programs.The course starts from the basics of computing and takes you through a tour of modern object-oriented programming, including classes, objects, control structures, inheritance, polymorphism, and genericity.Throughout the course, you will have the opportunity to learn the principles of programming as well as the techniques for designing correct and reliable programs by using the Eiffel programming language and notation. You will be trying out example problems, provide your solution, and see it immediately compiled and tested from within your browser.Beyond programming, you will also get a glimpse at theoretical computer science, the set of mathematical techniques that underlie computation and makes today\u2019s IT-based world possible. You should expect to devote five hours weekly to the course.

More recently, its scope has expanded to include things as diverse as data integrity, secure internet-wide communication, electronic cash, secure distributed computation, and more.Cryptography has also become ubiquitous. Perhaps unknowingly, we have all encountered applications of cryptography in our daily lives---whether by logging in using a password, making a web purchase over a secure connection, or applying a software update that is digitally signed.This course will introduce you to the foundations of modern cryptography, with an eye toward practical applications. We will learn the importance of carefully defining security; of relying on a set of well-studied \u201chardness assumptions\u201d (e.g., the hardness of factoring large numbers); and of the possibility of proving security of complicated constructions based on low-level primitives.

All the computation will eventually be carried out by hardware, namely the processor or the circuits.In this course, we will study security and trust from the hardware perspective. We will start with a short survey of the roles of hardware in security and trust. With all types of dedicated hardware/circuits, known as co-processors, being developed to speed up application specific computations, hardware\u2019s role changes from the enabler to an enhancer. Nowadays, hardware becomes the enforcer for secure systems because it is used to ensure that only the authenticated user and software can access the processor. However, current hardware design flow does not have security as a key design objective. Consequently, we will conduct several case studies where hardware turns into the weakest link in secure systems.Then we will review the fundamentals of digital logic design and use this as an example to analyze the source of security vulnerabilities and demonstrate how these vulnerabilities can become legitimate security threats. We conclude with the basic principles and practical methods of design for security and trust, as well as a study of the associated design cost. &nbsp;Next, we introduce physical attacks to popular digital systems such as smart cards and FPGA-based systems. We will focus on side-channel attacks, which have been demonstrated many times to be able to successfully reveal the secret cryptographic keys stored in the secure systems.

Standard countermeasures to these attacks will also be introduced.Finally we will learn the new hardware security primitives that can help us to build secure systems.

Although there will be 10 weeks of lecture material, the required core of the course is six weeks long and can be completed flexibly within the ten week schedule to provide flexibility for students during the summer.An extended case study project will be used throughout the required core of the MOOC to showcase architectures for communicating with the cloud using HTTP, server-side processing of mobile data using servlets and the Java Spring Framework, and scalable storage of data using no-SQL databases and other platforms. Due to the importance of building secure and scalable mobile/cloud platforms, this MOOC will not only show you how to program handheld systems that talk to the cloud, but how to do so securely, scalably, and efficiently. Security and scalability topics will be woven into discussions of cloud service creation so that students learn, from the start, how to create robust cloud services for mobile devices.Four weeks of optional lecture material will also be provided for students who would like to gain a deeper understanding of the patterns and frameworks for building cloud infrastructure building. This material will be presented in the context of the open-source&nbsp;JAWS&nbsp;web server, which is implemented in C++ as part of the&nbsp;ACE&nbsp;open-source object-oriented concurrent and networked programming toolkit.Although the cloud service topics in this course will be taught in the context of connecting mobile devices to the cloud, the concepts are broader and will give students the ability to create the cloud services to support large-scale web applications, such as social networking applications; cloud services for embedded systems, such ",

We will introduce Linear Lists, Stacks, Queues, Strings, Binary Trees, Trees and Graphs, which are fundamental data structures. Students will learn how to organize data efficiently and make tradeoffs between space and time complexity, design efficient and effective algorithms, and implement high quality programs to solve complex real-world problems.&nbsp;Syllabus\u7b2c\u4e00\u5468 &nbsp;\u6982\u8bba Week 1 Overview\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3&nbsp; Solving\nProblems\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u62bd\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b Data\nStructures and Abstract Data Types\u7b97\u6cd5\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5206\u7c7b The\nProperties and Categories of Algorithm\u7b97\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5ea6\u91cf\n&nbsp;Evaluating Efficiency of Algorithm&nbsp;\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5468&nbsp;\u7ebf\u6027\u8868&nbsp;Week 2 Linear Lists\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784 The Structure\nof Lists\u987a\u5e8f\u8868 Sequential\nLists\u94fe\u8868 Linked Lists\u987a\u5e8f\u8868\u548c\u94fe\u8868\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83 The\nComparison of Sequential Lists and Linked Lists\u7b2c\u4e09\u5468 \u6808\u4e0e\u961f\u5217&nbsp;Week 3 Stack and\nQueue\u6808 Stacks\u6808\u4e0e\u9012\u5f52 Stacks and\nRecursion\u9012\u5f52\u8f6c\u975e\u9012\u5f52\uff08\u9009\u4fee\uff09 Implementation of Recursion using Stacks (Optional)\u961f\u5217 Queues &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\u961f\u5217\u7684\u5e94\u7528 The\nApplication of Queues\u7b2c\u56db\u5468&nbsp;\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32 Week 4 Strings\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u57fa\u672c\u6982\u5ff5&nbsp;The Basic\nConcept of Strings\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u7ed3\u6784&nbsp;The\nStorage Structure of Strings\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u8fd0\u7b97\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0&nbsp;The Implementation\nof Strings\u2019 Operations\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\uff08\u9009\u4fee\uff09&nbsp;KMP Fast String Matching (Optional)&nbsp;\u7b2c\u4e94\u5468&nbsp;\u4e8c\u53c9\u6811\uff08\u4e0a\uff09Week 5&nbsp;Binary Trees I\u4e8c\u53c9\u6811\u7684\u6982\u5ff5&nbsp;The Basic\nConcept of Binary Trees\u4e8c\u53c9\u6811\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b&nbsp;The\nAbstract Data Type for a Binary Tree\u4e8c\u53c9\u6811\u7684\u641c\u7d22 &nbsp;Binary Tree Traversals\u4e8c\u53c9\u6811\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u7ed3\u6784&nbsp;The Storage\nStructures for Binary Trees\u7b2c\u516d\u5468&nbsp;\u4e8c\u53c9\u6811\uff08\u4e0b\uff09Week 6 Binary Trees\nII\u4e8c\u53c9\u641c\u7d22\u6811 &nbsp;Binary\nSearch Trees\u5806\u4e0e\u4f18\u5148\u961f\u5217&nbsp;Heaps\nand Priority QueuesHuffman\u6811\u53ca\u5176\u5e94\u7528&nbsp;&nbsp;Huffman Coding Trees and Its Application &nbsp;\u7b2c\u4e03\u5468&nbsp;\u6811&nbsp",

You will learn about data collection, description, analysis and interpretation in qualitative research. The qualitative approach often involves an iterative process. We will focus on the basic ingredients required for this process: data collection and analysis. A good qualitative analysis consists of a general strategy of analysis, clear analytic 'actions' and documentation of all the steps taken. An important analytical action is coding parts of the material. This forms the basis for the categorisation and interpretation of the data. In this course you will learn to use statistical software to perform the qualitative analysis. We will also discuss and compare different types of analysis and interpretation. The most important concepts in qualitative analysis will be discussed in light of these different types.SyllabusThe qualitative approach to empirical science has its own origin story and is associated with a different philosophy of science than the quantitative approach.

Images and videos are everywhere, from those we take with our mobile devices and share with our friends to those that we receive from Mars and the ones we see in the movie theatre, without forgetting the whole ensemble of images of our bodies that are taken in hospital visits. Image and video processing is the art of working with such images and movies, from making it possible to store and transmit them to making those dark and blurry images look nice, as well as interpreting and analyzing the medical data and recognizing our friends\u2019 faces in social pictures. This discipline is also fascinating because it uses tools from many areas of applied mathematics. In this class you will look behind the scenes of image and video processing, from the basic and classical tools to the most modern and advanced algorithms.The course will start with an introduction to the basics of image formation and the fundamental concepts that translate a physical scene into a digital image. We will then describe the underlying concepts of image compression, the enabling technology that makes it possible for images to be sent from Mars and videos to be stored in our mobile phones. We will cover the most fundamental tools in image enhancement, showing how simple tools can significantly improve images. Both geometric and non-geometric tools as well as spatial and non-spatial operations will be presented. Details on image segmentation will be provided, one of the most fundamental and useful problems in image processing. The above topics will be extended to color images and video. Once we have covered the fundamentals, which both provide the basis for modern image and video processing and serve many important applications until today, we will move into recent progress in the area, covering image inpainting (how to remove objects from images and video), image processing via sparse modeling and compressed sensing, geometric partial differential equations for image",

This course is about key technical concepts in game development, and has been developed for people of many different backgrounds and skills. Some programming experience would be nice but is not required.We start by looking at the central role of game design and common development processes used in the industry. You will see how game software can be broken into parts that work together, and in particular the idea of game engines. We&rsquo;ll explore the relationship between game design, balance and player experience. Lastly we&rsquo;ll look at enhancing player experience though the use of AI techniques.What will I learn?Essential game design elements and the role of a game designerKey game development stages and principles of agile game developmentHow games are like magic and real-time systemsThat programming is made up of simple steps, and how procedure and object oriented programming can help us structure our game codeHow messages and events are key concepts in games at different levels within game architectureAbout graphs and other data structures that help represent game worlds and charactersHow a game design can be described, modelled and implemented as simple game architectureAbout the emergence of game engines and the relationship of games to other data-driven applications, including concurrent and distributed architecturesHow to implement games using iterative step-by-step processes, by selecting, implementing and testingThat rules are central to games, and that game balance relates to fairness and bias for playersHow physics can be used to create realistic force-based movement, for individual characters and groupsAbout AI techniques that can add interesting behaviour to game characters, including decision making, action planning and path planningThis course requires approximately 2 - 4 hours of study per week, but can vary depending on the student.

Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. Some of the people taking the two courses will use them as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses, but for many it will be their first and last computer science courses.Since these courses may be the only formal computer science courses many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, they are not \"computation appreciation\" courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will.Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python covers the notion of computation, the Python programming language, some simple algorithms, testing and debugging, and informal introduction to algorithmic complexity, and some simple algorithms and data structures.Recommended textbook.\u00a0The recommended textbook for this course is: Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python, Revised and Expanded edition, by John Guttag (MIT Press, 2013).

B. mein Smartphone?Was sind die technischen Grundlagen f\u00fcr die Vielzahl von Informationen auf dem Web?Als weiteres wollen wir verstehen, wie sich Informationssysteme auf\nunser wirtschaftliches Umfeld auswirken.Weshalb\nlohnt es sich in Computer zu investieren?Welchen Mehrwert leisten diese f\u00fcr eine Firma?Wie,\nwo, und mit welcher Zielsetzung werden und sollen Computer demnach in Firmen und\nOrganisationen eingesetzt werden?Warum\nhaben Supermarktketten und Warenh\u00e4user moderne\nScannerkassen eingef\u00fchrt?Welche Besonderheiten haben Digitale G\u00fcter\n-- also Produkte, die nur aus einer Ansammlung von Daten bestehen, wie Musik,\nFilme, oder Software -- und wie wirken sich diese auf deren Handel aus?SyllabusDie Vorlesung gliedert sich in w\u00f6chentliche Themen. Diese sind:Woche 1: Einf\u00fchrungWoche 2-4: Technische GrundlagenProgrammierungHardware, Software, InfrastrukturDigitalisierung, Datenformate, DatenspeicherungWoche 5-6:\u00a0Informationssysteme im UnternehmenArten von InformationssystemenWert von InformationssystemenWoche 7: Der Wert von InformationWoche 8-9: Digitale G\u00fcter in der VolkswirtschaftEigenschaften und Besonderheiten digitaler G\u00fcterMassnahmen gegen MarktverzerrungenWettbewerbsstrategienDanach folgen 2-3 Wochen zum lernen und anschliessen eine Abschlusspr\u00fcfung.",

        "desc": "In a world that\u2019s full of data, we have many questions: How long do animals in a shelter have to wait until they are adopted? Can we model the growth of internet usage in a country? Do films with a more adult rating make more money that other rated films?Luckily, the world is also full of data to help us answer those questions. This course will walk through the basics of statistical thinking \u2013 starting with an interesting question. Then, we\u2019ll learn the correct statistical tool to help answer our question of interest \u2013 using R and hands-on Labs. Finally, we\u2019ll learn how to interpret our findings and develop a meaningful conclusion.This course will consist of instructional videos for statistical concepts broken down into manageable chunks \u2013 each followed by some guided questions to help your understanding of the topic. Most weeks, the instructional section will be followed by tutorial videos for using R, which we\u2019ll then apply to a hands-on Lab where we will answer a specific question using real-world datasets.We\u2019ll cover basic Descriptive Statistics in our first \u201cUnit\u201d \u2013 learning about visualizing and summarizing data. Unit two will be a \u201cmodeling\u201d investigation where we\u2019ll learn about linear, exponential, and logistic functions. We\u2019ll learn how to interpret and use those functions with a little bit of Pre-Calculus (but we\u2019ll keep it very basic). Finally in the third Unit, we\u2019ll learn about Inferential statistical tests such as the t-test, ANOVA, and chi-square.This course is intended to have the same \u201cpunch\u201d as a typical introductory undergraduate statistics course, with an added twist of modeling. This course is also intentionally devised to be sequential, with each new piece building on the previous topics. Once completed, students should feel comfortable using basic statistical techniques to answer their own questions about their own data, using a widely available statistical software package (R).I hope you\u2019ll join me in learning how to look at the world around ",

This course aims to make this cutting-edge material broadly accessible to undergraduate students, including computer science majors who do not have any prior exposure to quantum mechanics. The course starts with a simple introduction to the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics using the concepts of qubits (or quantum bits) and quantum gates. This treatment emphasizes the paradoxical nature of the subject, including entanglement, non-local correlations, the no-cloning theorem and quantum teleportation. The course covers the fundamentals of quantum algorithms, including the quantum fourier transform, period finding, Shor's quantum algorithm for factoring integers, as well as the prospects for quantum algorithms for NP-complete problems. It also discusses the basic ideas behind the experimental realization of quantum computers, including the prospects for adiabatic quantum optimization and the D-Wave controversy.Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs.

Application areas within NLP include automatic (machine) translation between languages; dialogue systems, which allow a human to interact with a machine using natural language; and information extraction, where the goal is to transform unstructured text into structured (database) representations that can be searched and browsed in flexible ways. NLP technologies are having a dramatic impact on the way people interact with computers, on the way people interact with each other through the use of language, and on the way people access the vast amount of linguistic data now in electronic form. From a scientific viewpoint, NLP involves fundamental questions of how to structure formal models (for example statistical models) of natural language phenomena, and of how to design algorithms that implement these models.In this course you will study mathematical and computational models of language, and the application of these models to key problems in natural language processing. The course has a focus on machine learning methods, which are widely used in modern NLP systems: we will cover formalisms such as hidden Markov models, probabilistic context-free grammars, log-linear models, and statistical models for machine translation. The curriculum closely follows a course currently taught by Professor Collins at Columbia University, and previously taught at MIT.SyllabusTopics covered include:1. Language modeling.2. Hidden Markov models, and tagging problems.3. Probabilistic context-free grammars, and the parsing problem.4. Statistical approaches to machine translation.5. Log-linear models, and their application to NLP problems.6. Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning in NLP.",

When related patterns are woven together they form a&nbsp;pattern language&nbsp;that provides a vocabulary and a process for the orderly resolution of software development problems. A&nbsp;framework&nbsp;is an integrated set of software components that collaborate to provide a reusable architecture for a family of related applications. Frameworks can also be viewed as concrete realizations of pattern languages that facilitate direct reuse of design and code.This course describes how to apply patterns and frameworks to alleviate many accidental and inherent complexities associated with developing and deploying concurrent and networked software. These patterns and frameworks have been used successfully in many domains, including telecom/datacom, mobile devices, electronic medical imaging, network management, ",

        "desc": "What are Probabilistic Graphical Models?Uncertainty is unavoidable in real-world applications: we can almost never predict with certainty what will happen in the future, and even in the present and the past, many important aspects of the world are not observed with certainty. Probability theory gives us the basic foundation to model our beliefs about the different possible states of the world, and to update these beliefs as new evidence is obtained. These beliefs can be combined with individual preferences to help guide our actions, and even in selecting which observations to make. While probability theory has existed since the 17th century, our ability to use it effectively on large problems involving many inter-related variables is fairly recent, and is due largely to the development of a framework known as Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). This framework, which spans methods such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, uses ideas from discrete data structures in computer science to efficiently encode and manipulate probability distributions over high-dimensional spaces, often involving hundreds or even many thousands of variables. These methods have been used in an enormous range of application domains, which include: web search, medical and fault diagnosis, image understanding, reconstruction of biological networks, speech recognition, natural language processing, decoding of messages sent over a noisy communication channel, robot navigation, and many more. The PGM framework provides an essential tool for anyone who wants to learn how to reason coherently from limited and noisy observations.In this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques; you will also learn algorithms for using a PGM to reach conclusions about the world from limited and noisy evidence, and for making good decisions under uncertainty.

These are three topics that build on the same mathematical background and that have several important connections: for example it is possible to find graph clusters via random walks, and it is possible to use the linear programming approach to graph partitioning as a way to study random walks.We will study spectral graph theory, which explains how certain combinatorial properties of graphs are related to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix, and we will use it describe and analyze spectral algorithms for graph partitioning and clustering. Spectral graph theory will recur as an important tool in the rest of the course. We we will also discuss other approaches to graph partitioning via linear programming and semidefinite programming. Then we will study constructions of expander graphs, which are graphs with very strong pseudorandomness properties, which are useful in many applications, including in cryptography, in complexity theory, in algorithms and data structures, and in coding theory.

What is the logical relationship among data?\n    How are the data stored in computers? What algorithms should be operated to solve the problems on the data? These are the questions that will be answered in \u201cData Structures and Algorithms\u201d, one of the most important core courses in Computer Science.\n    The course also covers fundamental data structures and classical algorithms which are widely used in the&nbsp;succeeding specialized courses,&nbsp;such as Operating Systems, Software Engineering, Database Systems, Compiler&nbsp;Principles, Computer\n    Graphics and Human Computer Interaction.What is the combination of data structures and algorithms? Niklaus Wirth wrote a book titled \"Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs\", which points out their important roles in computing discipline:&nbsp;algorithm and data structure are two closely linked\n    and indivisible parts of programming.The course will follow the idea of&nbsp; \u201cAlgorithms + Data",

Stories about\n    companies or scientists using data to recommend movies, discover who is\n    pregnant based on credit card receipts, or confirm the existence of the\n    Higgs Boson regularly appear in Forbes, the Economist, the Wall Street\n    Journal, and The New York Times. But how does one turn data into this type\n    of insight? The answer is data analysis and applied statistics. Data analysis\n    is the process of finding the right data to answer your question, understanding\n    the processes underlying the data, discovering the important patterns in\n    the data, and then communicating your results to have the biggest possible\n    impact. There is a critical shortage of people with these skills in the\n    workforce, which is why Hal Varian (Chief Economist at Google) says that\n    being a statistician will be the sexy job for the next 10 years.This course is an applied statistics course focusing on data analysis.\n    The course will begin with an overview of how to organize, perform, and\n    write-up data analyses. Then we will cover some of the most popular and\n    widely used statistical methods like linear regression, principal components\n    analysis, cross-validation, and p-values. Instead of focusing on mathematical\n    details, the lectures will be designed to help you apply these techniques\n    to real data using the R statistical programming language, interpret the\n    results, and diagnose potential problems in your analysis. You will also\n    have the opportunity to critique and assist your fellow classmates with\n    their data analyses.",

Reactive programming is an emerging discipline which combines concurrency and event-based and asynchronous systems. It is essential for writing any kind of web-service or distributed system and is also at the core of many high-performance concurrent systems. Reactive programming can be seen as a natural extension of higher-order functional programming to concurrent systems that deal with distributed state&nbsp;by coordinating and orchestrating asynchronous data streams exchanged by actors.In this course you will discover key elements for writing reactive programs in a composable way. You will find out how to apply these building blocks in the construction of event-driven systems that are scalable and resilient.The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series of assignments, which are also programming projects.Personalized Tutoring by Typesafe: Typesafe offers supervised tutorial sessions accompanying select Coursera classes. In weekly, one-hour tutorial sessions experts from Typesafe provide in-depth answers to questions about the course material, and discuss solutions to homework assignments past the deadline. Tutorial groups are small (10 participants max) in order to meet individual mentoring needs as much as possible. Tutorial session slots are offered in both European and American time zones.Registration for tutoring by Typesafe is open.SyllabusWeek 1: Review of Principles of Functional Programming: substitution model, for-expressions and how they relate to monads.",

Certain features of this course may not be active, but many people enjoy watching the videos and working with the materials. Make sure to check for reruns of this course.\nThis course gives an introduction to all major programming concepts, techniques, and paradigms in a unified framework. We cover the three main programming paradigms: functional, object-oriented, and declarative dataflow. We explain the four ways to do data abstraction and discuss the trade-offs between objects and abstract data types. We present declarative dataflow, the most useful paradigm for concurrent programming, and show how it avoids race conditions. We give a simple formal semantics for all concepts and illustrate them with practical code that runs on the accompanying open-source platform, the Mozart Programming System. This course is targeted toward people with a basic knowledge of programming. It will be most useful to beginning programming students, but the unconventional approach should be insightful even to seasoned professionals.\nTo learn more about the practical organization of the course, watch our second introductory video: http://youtu.be/M0Dlswd_hIQ\nAll required readings are available within the courseware, courtesy of The MIT Press.

The learner is assumed to have no prior experience of programming, but is expected to be at the level of a second year undergraduate college student in science or engineering. The course will run over ten weeks with about 2-3 hours of lectures per week.At the end of each week, the learner is expected to write some programs and submit them for grading. These programming problems are classified as easy, moderate or difficult. The easy problems, typically, are repeats from the lecture. The moderate and difficult ones will require increasing levels of initiative from the learner.&nbsp;In addition, at the end of each week the learner is expected to answer a set of objective-type assessment questions.&nbsp;SyllabusIntroduction to Computers and ProgrammingWriting your first programVariables and operators and expressionsVariable declarations, more operators, precedenceInput, Output StatementsConditionalsLoopsArrays and Multidimensional arraysPointersFunctionsRunning time of a programComputing time complexityPolynomial evaluation and multiplicationSearching: Linear and BinaryFinding minimum and maximumSorting I: Insertion, MergeSorting II: Counting, RadixFinding i-th smallest numberStructures and User-defined data typesBrief introduction to C++: Classes and objectsData Structures: Abstract Data TypeListsStacks: Last In First OutQueues: First In First OutTreesTree traversalHeapsGraphs and RepresentationGreedy algorithmsDynamic programmingMatrix Chain MultiplicationDijkstra's AlgorithmStringsBoyer-Moore String Matching AlgorithmFile I/OModular Programming",

How does it affect our democratic institutions? Do you know that the metadata collected by a cellular network speaks volumes about its users? In this course you will explore all of these questions while investigating related issues in WiFi and Internet surveillance. The issues explored in this course are at the intersection of networking technology, law, and sociology and will appeal to anyone interested in the technical, political, and moral questions inherent in the use of information networks. The course will include broad overviews for the novice, while pointing to the detailed resources needed for those engaged in the development of corporate or governmental policies.",

As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students.An optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java.I hope you enjoy the course!Why Study Compilers?Everything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years.

Its contents are heavily influenced by the idea that data analysis\nshould help in enhancing and augmenting knowledge of the domain as represented\nby the concepts and statements of relation between them. According to this\nview, two main pathways for data analysis are summarization, for developing and\naugmenting concepts, and correlation, for enhancing and establishing relations.\nThe term summarization embraces here both simple summaries like totals and\nmeans and more complex summaries: the principal\ncomponents of a set of features and cluster structures in a set of entities.\nSimilarly, correlation covers both bivariate and multivariate relations between\ninput and target features including Bayes classifiers.The view of the data as a subject of\ncomputational data analysis that is adhered to here has emerged quite recently.\nTypically, in sciences and in statistics, a problem comes first, and then the\ninvestigator turns to data that might be useful in advancing towards a\nsolution. Yet nowadays the situation is reversed frequently, especially with\nthe advent of Big Data. Typical questions then are: Take a look at this data\nset - what sense can be made out of it? \u2013 Is there any structure in the data\nset? Can these features help in predicting those? This is more reminiscent to a\ntraveler\u2019s view of the world rather than that of a scientist.

Despite many improvements in processors, storage, and networks, however, developing quality software on-time and on-budget remains hard. Moreover,\n    developing high qualityreusableconcurrent and&nbsp;networked software apps and services is even harder. &nbsp;The principles, methods, and&nbsp;skills required to develop such software are best learned by&nbsp;attaining mastery of&nbsp;patterns,pattern languages,\n    andframeworks.Apattern&nbsp;describes a reusable solution to a common problem that arises within a particular context.

        "desc": "This course introduces acoustics by using the concept of impedance. It starts with vibrations and waves, demonstrating how vibrations can be envisaged as a kind of wave, mathematically and physically. The essential measures for acoustic waves, such as dB scale, octave scale, acoustic pressure, energy, intensity, will also be explained. These measures are realized by one-dimensional examples, which provide clear and simple physical insights.The course then moves on to explaining waves on a flat surface of discontinuity, demonstrating how propagation characteristics of waves change in space where there is a distributed impedance mismatch.&nbsp;Subsequent topics are radiation, scattering, and diffraction, which can be explained in a unified way by seeing the changes of waves due to spatially distributed impedance. Lastly, the course covers sound in closed space, which is considered to be a space that is surrounded by spatially distributed impedance, and introduces two spaces: acoustically large and small space. In Part 1, we will handle topics from vibrations and waves to waves on a flat surface of discontinuity. The later&nbsp;parts will be&nbsp;covered in Part 2.This course is for graduate students and advanced undergraduates in acoustics, audio engineering, and noise control engineering. Practicing engineers and researchers in audio engineering and noise control, or students in engineering and physics disciplines, who want to gain an understanding of sound and vibration concepts, are also welcome.SyllabusWeek 1: Vibration &amp; WavesHow are time and space&nbsp;related? What about the relation between frequency and wavelength?Does the characteristic impedance of medium determine reflection and transmission?Do we well see the waves of a string in terms of driving point impedance?&nbsp;Week 2: Acoustics Wave Equation and Its Basic Physical Measures(1D acoustic wave equation, Acoustic Intensity and Energy, Units of Sound)What are&nbsp;the relations of acoustic pressure,",

We will discuss the game of baseball, not through consensus or a fan\u2019s conventional wisdom, but by searching for objective knowledge in hitting, pitching, and fielding performance. These and other areas of sabermetrics will be analyzed and better understood with current and historical baseball data.The course also serves as applied introduction to the basics of data science, a growing field of scholarship, that requires skills in computation, statistics, and communicating results of analyses. Using baseball data, the basics of statistical regression, the R Language, and SQL will be covered.This course has been successfully taught at the Experimental College at Tufts University since 2004. Many of its former students have gone on to careers writing about baseball and working in various MLB baseball operations and analytics departments.Professor Andres talks about the science of baseball: The Science of the Home Run, TedXYouth@Beacon Street.",

People from many different backgrounds now want to understand the basics of programming, because it&rsquo;s both fun and an increasingly valuable skill. One of the most exciting ways to learn programming is through authoring your own creative programs. Known as &ldquo;creative coding&rdquo;, this growing field uses computer software as a medium to develop original creative expression. So if you&rsquo;re an artist, designer, architect or musician who&rsquo;s interested in how you can expand your creative skills, or even a computer programmer looking to work in creative applications, you will find this course extremely useful.Throughout the course we&rsquo;ll help you develop practical programming concepts and skills by exploring creative ideas and challenges. We&rsquo;ll be looking at the history and philosophy behind artistic uses of technology, so you can gain a greater understanding of how best to express your own creative vision using the software you write. The aim is to teach you &ldquo;algorithmic thinking&rdquo; &ndash; ways to conceptualise and model the world so you can express creative ideas using computer programs. A background in programming is not assumed or necessary.Each week we will start with a simple creative idea and guide you through turning that idea into a working computer program. We&rsquo;ll be exploring programs that can generate images, animations and sound and you&rsquo;ll learn how you can interact with them to change their behaviour. As you&rsquo;ll discover, this opens a world of possibilities, because as you expand and modify your program new creative possibilities emerge. Starting with simple processes we will look at how to create increasingly complex and nuanced visual and sonic artworks using generative programming techniques. Assignments will give you the opportunity to explore your own creative ideas and share your achievements with fellow stu",

You'll learn several techniques for rapidly prototyping and evaluating multiple interface alternatives -- and why rapid prototyping and comparative evaluation are essential to excellent interaction design. You'll learn how to conduct fieldwork with people to help you get design ideas. How to make paper prototypes and low-fidelity mock-ups that are interactive -- and how to use these designs to get feedback from other stakeholders like your teammates, clients, and users. You'll learn principles of visual design so that you can effectively organize and present information with your interfaces. You'll learn principles of perception and cognition that inform effective interaction design. And you'll learn how to perform and analyze controlled experiments online. In many cases, we'll use Web design as the anchoring domain. A lot of the examples will come from the Web, and we'll talk just a bit about Web technologies in particular. When we do so, it will be to support the main goal of this course, which is helping you build human-centered design skills, so that you have the principles and methods to create excellent interfaces with any technology.",

Those who successfully complete the course will receive a statement of accomplishment. You will need a decent Internet connection for accessing course materials, but should be able to watch the videos on your smartphone.The course covers four broad areas: (1) Finite automata and regular expressions, (2) Context-free grammars, (3) Turing machines and decidability, and (4) the theory of intractability, or NP-complete problems.Why Study Automata Theory?This subject is not just for those planning to enter the field of complexity theory, although it is a good place to start if that is your goal. Rather, the course will emphasize those aspects of the theory that people really use in practice. Finite automata, regular expressions, and context-free grammars are ideas that have stood the test of time. They are essential tools for compilers. But more importantly, they are used in many systems that require input that is less general than a full programming language yet more complex than \"push this button.\"The concepts of undecidable problems and intractable problems serve a different purpose. Undecidable problems are those for which no computer solution can ever exist, while intractable problems are those for which there is strong evidence that, although they can be solved by a computer, they cannot be solved sufficiently fast that the solution is truly useful in practice. Understanding this theory, and in particular being able to prove that a problem you are facing belongs to one of these classes, allows you to justify taking another approach \u2014 simplifying the problem or writing code to approximate the solution, for example.During",

        "desc": "The ability to reason is fundamental to human beings. Whatever the discipline or discourse it is important to be able to distinguish correct reasoning from incorrect reasoning. The consequences of incorrect reasoning can be minor, like getting lost on the way to a birthday party, or more significant, for example launching nuclear missiles at a flock of ducks, or permanently losing contact with a space craft.The fundamental question that we will address in this course is \"when does one statement necessarily follow from another\" --- or in the terminology of the course, \"when is one statement a&nbsp;logical consequence&nbsp;of another\". This is an issue of some importance, since an answer to the question would allow us to examine an argument presented in a blog, for example, and to decide whether it really demonstrates the truth of the conclusion of the argument. Our own reasoning might also improve, since we would also be able to analyze our own arguments to see whether they really do demonstrate their conclusions.In this course you will be introduced to the concepts and techniques used in logic. We will start right from the beginning, assuming no prior exposure to this or similar material, and progress through discussions of the proof and model theories of propositional and first-order logic.We will proceed by giving a theory of truth, and of logical consequence, based on a formal language called FOL (the language of First-Order Logic). We adopt a formal language for making statements, since natural languages (like English, for example) are far too vague and ambiguous for us to analyze sufficiently. Armed with the formal language, we will be able to model the notions of truth, proof and consequence, among others.While logic is technical in nature, the key concepts in the course will be developed by considering natural English statements, and we will focus the relationships between such statements and their FOL counterparts. The goal of the course is to show how natur",

What is the logical relationship among data? How is data stored in computers? What algorithms are required to solve particular problems? These are the questions that will be answered in \u201cData Structures and Algorithms,\u201d an important core course in Computer Science. The course also introduces students to fundamental data structures and classical algorithms used in more specialized courses,\u00a0including Operating Systems, Software Engineering, Database Systems, Compiler\u00a0Principles, Computer Graphics and Human Computer Interaction.Niklaus Wirth described the important and indivisible link between algorithms and data structure in his book, Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs.The course will build on Wirth\u2019s ideas as it helps students improve their knowledge of theory and their ability to think abs",

        "desc": "You pick up your iPhone while waiting in line at a coffee shop. You google a not-so-famous actor, get linked to a Wikipedia entry listing his recent movies and popular YouTube clips of several of them. You check out user reviews on Amazon and pick one,\ndownload that movie on BitTorrent or stream that in Netflix. But suddenly the WiFi logo on your phone is gone and you're on 3G. Video quality starts to degrade, but you don't know if it's the server getting crowded or the Internet is congested somewhere.\nIn any case, it costs you $10 per Gigabyte, and you decide to stop watching the movie, and instead multitask between sending tweets and calling your friend on Skype, while songs stream from iCloud to your phone. You're happy with the call quality, but\nget a little irritated when you see there're no new followers on Twitter. You may wonder how they all kind of work, and why sometimes they don't. Take a look at the list of 20 questions below. Each question is selected not just for its relevance to our\ndaily lives, but also for the core concepts in the field of networking illustrated by its answers. This course is about formulating and answering some of these 20 questions.SyllabusWhat makes CDMA work for my smartphone?How does Google rank webpages?How does Netflix recommend movies?Why do AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless charge me $10 a GB?How does traffic get through the Internet?Why doesn't the Internet collapse under congestion?Why is WiFi faster at home than at a hotspot?",

        "desc": "This course introduces the cornerstones of functional programming using the Scala programming language. Functional programming has become more and more popular in recent years because it promotes code that\u2019s safe, concise, and elegant. Furthermore, functional programming makes it easier to write parallel code for today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s multiprocessors by replacing mutable variables and loops with powerful ways to define and compose functions.Scala is a language that fuses functional and object-oriented programming in a practical package. It interoperates seamlessly with Java and its tools. Scala is now used in a rapidly increasing number of open source projects and companies. It provides the core infrastructure for sites such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare, Tumblr, and Klout.In this course you will discover the elements of the functional programming style and learn how to apply them usefully in your daily programming tasks. You will also develop a solid foundation for reasoning about functional programs, by touching upon proofs of invariants and the tracing of execution symbolically.The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series of assignments, most of which are also programming projects.SyllabusWeek One:Programming paradigms; overview of functional programming and the Scala programming language.Week Two:Defining and using functions, recursion and non-termination, working with functions as values, reasoning by reduction.Week Three:Defining and using immutable objects, review of inheritance and dynamic binding.Week Four:Types and Pattern MatchingWeek Five:Working with ListsWeek Six:Collections and Combinatorial SearchWeek Seven:Lazy Evaluation",

        "desc": "This course is designed to help students with very little or no computing background learn the basics of building simple interactive applications.  Our language of choice, Python, is an easy-to learn, high-level computer language that is used in many of the computational courses offered on Coursera.  To make learning Python easy, we have developed a new browser-based programming environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple.  These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse.The primary method for learning the course material will be to work through multiple \"mini-projects\" in Python.  To make this class enjoyable, these projects will include building fun games such as Pong, Blackjack, and Asteroids. When you\u2019ve finished our course, we can\u2019t promise that you will be a professional programmer, but we think that you will learn a lot about programming in Python and have fun while you\u2019re doing it.SyllabusOur course syllabus can be seen atwww.codeskulptor.org/coursera/interactivepython.html.",

Building on a computer organization base, this course explores techniques that go into designing a modern microprocessor. Fundamental understanding of computer architecture is key not only for students interested in hardware and processor design, but is a foundation for students interested in compilers, operating systems, and high performance programming. This course will explore how the computer architect can utilize the increasing number of transistors available to improve the performance of a processor. Focus will be given to architectures that can exploit different forms of parallelism, whether they be implicit or explicit. This course covers architectural techniques such as multi-issue superscalar processors, out-of-order processors, Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) processors, advanced caching, and multiprocessor systems.",

Certain features of this course may not be active, but many people enjoy watching the videos and working with the materials. Make sure to check for reruns of this course.Louv1.1x\u00a0(starting Sep. 22, 2014) and Louv1.2x (coming in Nov. 2014) together give an introduction to all major programming concepts, techniques, and paradigms in a unified framework. We cover the three main programming paradigms : functional, object-oriented, and declarative dataflow.The two courses are targeted toward people with a basic knowledge of programming. It will be most useful to beginning programming students, but the unconventional approach should be insightful even to seasoned professionals.Louv1.1x covers fundamental concepts. You\u2019ll learn functional programming, its techniques and its data structures. You\u2019ll use simple formal semantics for all concepts, and see those concepts illustrated with practical code that runs on the accompanying open-source platform, the Mozart Programming System.Louv1.2x covers data abstraction, state, and concurrency. You\u2019ll learn the four ways to do data abstraction and discuss the trade-offs between objects and abstract data types. You\u2019ll be exposed to deterministic dataflow, the most useful paradigm for concurrent programming, and learn how it avoids race conditions.To learn more about the practical organization of the two courses, watch the introductory video.At the end of Louv1.1x and Louv1.2x, the successful participant will be able to :Specify problems, break them down into their basic steps, and design algorithms and abstractions to solve themChoose the right programming paradigm and write a program in this paradigm to solve a problemUse formal semantics to reason about program correctnessWrite small concurrent programs in the deterministic dataflow paradigm",

Thanks to spatial computing, a hiker in Yellowstone and a taxi driver in Manhattan can know precisely where\n    they are, discover nearby points of interest and learn how to reach their destinations. Spatial computing technology is what powers the Foursquare check-in, the maps app on your smartphone, the devices used by scientists to track endangered species,\n    the routing directions that help you get from point A to point B, the precision agriculture technology that is revolutionizing farming, and the augmented reality devices like Google Glass that may soon mediate our interaction with the real world.This course introduces the fundamental ideas underlying spatial computing services, systems, and sciences. Topics covered will include the nature of geospatial information, proper statistical frameworks for working with geospatial data, key algorithms\n    and data structures, spatial data mining, and cartography/geovisualization. We will also address applied topics such as where to find spatial data, how to use powerful open source software to analyze and map spatial data, and frameworks for building\n    location-based services.Three Ways to Enjoy this Course:This course is designed to support three different types of students and educational goals:Curiosity Track: Most of us interact with spatial technologies every day. This track is for students who wish to learn about one or two spatial computing topics, but not commit to an entire course.

It is also a very dynamic field, where many new techniques are being designed every day, and the hot techniques and theories at times can rise and disappear rapidly. Thus, users of machine learning from other fields often face the problem of choosing or using the techniques properly. In this course, we emphasize the necessary fundamentals that give any student of machine learning a \nsolid foundation, and enable him or her to exploit current techniques properly, explore \nfurther techniques and theories, or perhaps to contribute their own in the future.The course roughly corresponds to the first half-semester of the National Taiwan University course \"Machine Learning\", and the second half-semester is expected to be on Coursera under the name \"Machine Learning Techniques\" soon in the future. Based on five years of teaching this popular course successfully (including winning the most prestigious teaching award of National Taiwan University) and discussing with many other scholars actively, the instructor chooses to focus on what he believes to be the core topics that every student of the subject should know.

At its core, it is an innovative, in-memory, relational database management system that exploits all the capabilities of current hardware to increase application performance, reduce total cost of ownership, and enable new scenarios and applications that were not possible before.SAP HANA enables you to build applications that integrate the business logic, the control logic, and the database layer with unprecedented performance. As a developer, one of the key issues is how to minimize data movements. The more you can do directly on the data in memory next to the CPUs, the better the application will perform.This course will build upon last year&rsquo;s&nbsp;Introduction to Software Development on SAP HANA&nbsp;course and go deeper into each of the major topics around SAP HANA native development. We will explore the many advances in the programming model and tooling that came with SAP HANA SPS6, SPS7, and SPS8.During the course, we will use SAP HANA studio as well as several new Web-based tools (for example, the Web-based Development Workbench, SAP HANA Lifecycle Management, and SAP HANA XS Administration Tool).We will also go well beyond the basics of each of the programming models, allowing discussion of deeper, real-world patterns and anti-patterns. We will look at the architecture of applications that are not just read-only or analytic but also transactional or provide an interface with transactional systems. We will also look at the extended capabilities of SAP HANA, from beyond a database to a complete application platform.Registration, learning content, final exam, and Record of Achievement are free of charge.

        "desc": "Broadly speaking, functional programming is a style of programming in which the primary method of computation is the application of functions to arguments. Among other features, functional languages offer a compact notation for writing programs, powerful abstraction methods for structuring programs, and a simple mathematical basis that supports reasoning about programs.Functional languages represent the leading edge of programming language design, and the primary setting in which new programming concepts are introduced and studied. All contemporary programming languages such as Hack/PHP, C#, Visual Basic, F#, C++, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Racket, \u2026 support higher-order programming via the concept of closures or lambda expressions.This course will use Haskell as the medium for understanding the basic principles of functional programming. While the specific language isn't all that important, Haskell is a pure functional language so it is entirely appropriate for learning the essential ingredients of programming using mathematical functions. It is also a relatively small language, and hence it should be easy for you to get up to speed with Haskell.Once you understand the Why, What and How that underlies pure functional programming and learned to \u201cthink like a fundamentalist\u201d, we will apply the concepts of functional programming to \u201ccode like a hacker\u201d in mainstream programming languages, using Facebook\u2019s novel Hack language as our main example.This course assumes no prior knowledge of functional programming, but assumes you have at least one year of programming experience in a regular programming language such as Java, .NET, Javascript or PHP.LICENSEThe course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Netherlands License.",

Through better use of data, leaders are able to plan and enact strategies with greater clarity and confidence. Data drives increased organizational efficiency and a competitive advantage. Simply, analytics provide new insight and actionable intelligence.In education, the use of data and analytics to improve learning is referred to as learning analytics. Analytics have not yet made the impact on education that they have made in other fields. That\u2019s starting to change. Software companies, researchers, educators, and university leaders recognize the value of data in improving not only teaching and learning, but the entire education sector. In particular, learning analytics enables universities, schools, and corporate training departments to improve the quality of learning and overall competitiveness. Research communities such as the International Educational Data Mining Society (IEDMS) and the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) are developing promising models for improving learner success through predictive analytics, machine learning, recommender systems (content and social), network analysis, tracking the development of concepts through social systems, discourse analysis, and intervention and support strategies.

As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students.An optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java.I hope you enjoy the course!WHY STUDY COMPILERS?Everything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years.

It is not sufficient to focus on data storage and data\nanalysis. The data scientist also needs to relate data to process analysis.Process\nmining bridges the gap between traditional model-based process analysis (e.g.,\nsimulation and other business process management techniques) and data-centric\nanalysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining.Process mining\nseeks the confrontation between event data (i.e., observed behavior) and\nprocess models (hand-made or discovered automatically). This technology has\nbecome available only recently, but it can be applied to any type of operational\nprocesses (organizations and systems). Example applications include: analyzing\ntreatment processes in hospitals, improving customer service processes in a\nmultinational, understanding the browsing behavior of customers using a booking\nsite, analyzing failures of a baggage handling system, and improving the user\ninterface of an X-ray machine. All of these applications have in common that\ndynamic behavior needs to be related to process models. Hence, we refer to this\nas \"data science in action\".The course explains the key analysis\ntechniques in process mining. Participants will learn various process discovery\nalgorithms. These can be used to automatically learn process models from raw\nevent data. Various other process analysis techniques that use event data will\nbe presented.

        "desc": "SAP Business Warehouse (BW) continues to serve as a powerful data warehouse to consolidate data, harmonize master data and provide flexible reporting scenarios. Introducing SAP HANA as database underneath SAP BW was a major breakthrough in various core areas for data warehousing. With the combination of a rich data warehousing application and a fast in-memory database, we&rsquo;ve seen architectural simplification, performance improvements and new modelling experiences.The course will introduce the renewed concepts and possibilities when SAP BW is powered by SAP HANA. We&rsquo;ll introduce the major guiding points and semantics of a data warehouse and demonstrate them in a business scenario, directly in the system. You will learn and experience the latest developments, with SAP BW 7.4 powered by SAP HANA, as well as opportunities for real-time data integration and agile data modelling. We will demonstrate what it means to consume the data via a data warehouse and show you how SAP HANA helps to speed up data analysis. We&rsquo;ll also introduce the planning capabilities based on SAP BW, which is a unique combination of reporting and planning on the same platform.The registration, learning content, final exam, and the Record of Achievement are free of charge.Target AudienceConsultantsImplementation expertsArchitectsDevelopersCourse RequirementsA basic understanding of data warehousingIt is preferable to have pre-basic SAP BW knowledge.You should have already walked through the openSAP course&nbsp;ABAP Development for SAP HANA, since some concepts will be shared and further developed.SyllabusWeek 1:SAP BW powered by SAP HANA &ndash; IntroWeek 2:Data Integration &amp; ManagementWeek 3:Data Consumption &amp; AnalysisWeek 4:Planning &amp; Lifecycle ManagementI Like, I Wish:We Love Your Feedback &hellip; And Want MoreFinal Exam:Good Luck!",

We cover the three main programming paradigms: functional, object-oriented, and declarative dataflow.The two courses are targeted toward people with a basic knowledge of programming. It will be most useful to beginning programming students, but the unconventional approach should be insightful even to seasoned professionals.Louv1.1x (Fundamentals) covers\u00a0functional programming, its techniques and its data structures. You\u2019ll use simple formal semantics for all concepts, and see those concepts illustrated with practical code that runs on the accompanying open-source platform, the Mozart Programming System.Louv1.2x (Abstraction and Concurrency)\u00a0covers data abstraction, state, and concurrency. You\u2019ll learn the four ways to do data abstraction and discuss the trade-offs between objects and abstract data types. You\u2019ll be exposed to deterministic dataflow, the most useful paradigm for concurrent programming, and learn how it avoids race conditions.To learn more about the practical organization of the two courses,\u00a0watch the introductory video.At the end of Louv1.1x and Louv1.2x, the successful participant will be able to :Specify problems, break them down into their basic steps, and design algorithms and abstractions to solve themChoose the right programming paradigm and write a program in this paradigm to solve a problemUse formal semantics to reason about program correctnessWrite small concurrent programs in the deterministic dataflow paradigm",
