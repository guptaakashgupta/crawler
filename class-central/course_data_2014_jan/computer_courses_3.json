        "desc": "This course is designed to help students with very little or no computing background learn the basics of building simple interactive applications.  Our language of choice, Python, is an easy-to learn, high-level computer language that is used in many of the computational courses offered on Coursera.  To make learning Python easy, we have developed a new browser-based programming environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple.  These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse.The primary method for learning the course material will be to work through multiple \"mini-projects\" in Python.  To make this class enjoyable, these projects will include building fun games such as Pong, Blackjack, and Asteroids. When you\u2019ve finished our course, we can\u2019t promise that you will be a professional programmer, but we think that you will learn a lot about programming in Python and have fun while you\u2019re doing it.SyllabusOur course syllabus can be seen atwww.codeskulptor.org/coursera/interactivepython.html.",

Building on a computer organization base, this course explores techniques that go into designing a modern microprocessor. Fundamental understanding of computer architecture is key not only for students interested in hardware and processor design, but is a foundation for students interested in compilers, operating systems, and high performance programming. This course will explore how the computer architect can utilize the increasing number of transistors available to improve the performance of a processor. Focus will be given to architectures that can exploit different forms of parallelism, whether they be implicit or explicit. This course covers architectural techniques such as multi-issue superscalar processors, out-of-order processors, Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) processors, advanced caching, and multiprocessor systems.",

        "desc": "Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being\n    explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us\n    self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search,\n    and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning\n    is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without\n    knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress\n    towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective\n    machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting\n    them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only\n    the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical\n    know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new\n    problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices\n    in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining,\n    and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning\n    (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels,\n    neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality\n    reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in\n    machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning\n    and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications,\n    so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building\n    smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam),\n    computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other\n    areas.",

We cover the three main programming paradigms : functional, object-oriented, and declarative dataflow.The two courses are targeted toward people with a basic knowledge of programming. It will be most useful to beginning programming students, but the unconventional approach should be insightful even to seasoned professionals.Louv1.1x covers fundamental concepts. You\u2019ll learn functional programming, its techniques and its data structures. You\u2019ll use simple formal semantics for all concepts, and see those concepts illustrated with practical code that runs on the accompanying open-source platform, the Mozart Programming System.Louv1.2x covers data abstraction, state, and concurrency. You\u2019ll learn the four ways to do data abstraction and discuss the trade-offs between objects and abstract data types. You\u2019ll be exposed to deterministic dataflow, the most useful paradigm for concurrent programming, and learn how it avoids race conditions.To learn more about the practical organization of the two courses, watch the introductory video.At the end of Louv1.1x and Louv1.2x, the successful participant will be able to :Specify problems, break them down into their basic steps, and design algorithms and abstractions to solve themChoose the right programming paradigm and write a program in this paradigm to solve a problemUse formal semantics to reason about program correctnessWrite small concurrent programs in the deterministic dataflow paradigm",

Thanks to spatial computing, a hiker in Yellowstone and a taxi driver in Manhattan can know precisely where\n    they are, discover nearby points of interest and learn how to reach their destinations. Spatial computing technology is what powers the Foursquare check-in, the maps app on your smartphone, the devices used by scientists to track endangered species,\n    the routing directions that help you get from point A to point B, the precision agriculture technology that is revolutionizing farming, and the augmented reality devices like Google Glass that may soon mediate our interaction with the real world.This course introduces the fundamental ideas underlying spatial computing services, systems, and sciences. Topics covered will include the nature of geospatial information, proper statistical frameworks for working with geospatial data, key algorithms\n    and data structures, spatial data mining, and cartography/geovisualization. We will also address applied topics such as where to find spatial data, how to use powerful open source software to analyze and map spatial data, and frameworks for building\n    location-based services.Three Ways to Enjoy this Course:This course is designed to support three different types of students and educational goals:Curiosity Track: Most of us interact with spatial technologies every day.

Thus, users of machine learning from other fields often face the problem of choosing or using the techniques properly. In this course, we emphasize the necessary fundamentals that give any student of machine learning a \nsolid foundation, and enable him or her to exploit current techniques properly, explore \nfurther techniques and theories, or perhaps to contribute their own in the future.The course roughly corresponds to the first half-semester of the National Taiwan University course \"Machine Learning\", and the second half-semester is expected to be on Coursera under the name \"Machine Learning Techniques\" soon in the future. Based on five years of teaching this popular course successfully (including winning the most prestigious teaching award of National Taiwan University) and discussing with many other scholars actively, the instructor chooses to focus on what he believes to be the core topics that every student of the subject should know.

Humans and animals move much more aggressively by routinely executing motions which involve a loss of instantaneous control authority. Controlling nonlinear systems without complete control authority requires methods that can reason about and exploit the natural dynamics of our machines.This course introduces nonlinear dynamics and control of underactuated mechanical systems, with an emphasis on computational methods. Topics include the nonlinear dynamics of robotic manipulators, applied optimal and robust control and motion planning. Discussions include examples from biology and applications to legged locomotion, compliant manipulation, underwater robots, and flying machines.",

At its core, it is an innovative, in-memory, relational database management system that exploits all the capabilities of current hardware to increase application performance, reduce total cost of ownership, and enable new scenarios and applications that were not possible before.SAP HANA enables you to build applications that integrate the business logic, the control logic, and the database layer with unprecedented performance. As a developer, one of the key issues is how to minimize data movements. The more you can do directly on the data in memory next to the CPUs, the better the application will perform.This course will build upon last year&rsquo;s&nbsp;Introduction to Software Development on SAP HANA&nbsp;course and go deeper into each of the major topics around SAP HANA native development. We will explore the many advances in the programming model and tooling that came with SAP HANA SPS6, SPS7, and SPS8.During the course, we will use SAP HANA studio as well as several new Web-based tools (for example, the Web-based Development Workbench, SAP HANA Lifecycle Management, and SAP HANA XS Administration Tool).We will also go well beyond the basics of each of the programming models, allowing discussion of deeper, real-world patterns and anti-patterns. We will look at the architecture of applications that are not just read-only or analytic but also transactional or provide an interface with transactional systems. We will also look at the extended capabilities of SAP HANA, from beyond a database to a complete application platform.Registration, learning content, final exam, and Record of Achievement are free of charge.

        "desc": "Broadly speaking, functional programming is a style of programming in which the primary method of computation is the application of functions to arguments. Among other features, functional languages offer a compact notation for writing programs, powerful abstraction methods for structuring programs, and a simple mathematical basis that supports reasoning about programs.Functional languages represent the leading edge of programming language design, and the primary setting in which new programming concepts are introduced and studied. All contemporary programming languages such as Hack/PHP, C#, Visual Basic, F#, C++, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Racket, \u2026 support higher-order programming via the concept of closures or lambda expressions.This course will use Haskell as the medium for understanding the basic principles of functional programming. While the specific language isn't all that important, Haskell is a pure functional language so it is entirely appropriate for learning the essential ingredients of programming using mathematical functions. It is also a relatively small language, and hence it should be easy for you to get up to speed with Haskell.Once you understand the Why, What and How that underlies pure functional programming and learned to \u201cthink like a fundamentalist\u201d, we will apply the concepts of functional programming to \u201ccode like a hacker\u201d in mainstream programming languages, using Facebook\u2019s novel Hack language as our main example.This course assumes no prior knowledge of functional programming, but assumes you have at least one year of programming experience in a regular programming language such as Java, .NET, Javascript or PHP.LICENSEThe course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Netherlands License.",

Through better use of data, leaders are able to plan and enact strategies with greater clarity and confidence. Data drives increased organizational efficiency and a competitive advantage. Simply, analytics provide new insight and actionable intelligence.In education, the use of data and analytics to improve learning is referred to as learning analytics. Analytics have not yet made the impact on education that they have made in other fields. That\u2019s starting to change. Software companies, researchers, educators, and university leaders recognize the value of data in improving not only teaching and learning, but the entire education sector. In particular, learning analytics enables universities, schools, and corporate training departments to improve the quality of learning and overall competitiveness. Research communities such as the International Educational Data Mining Society (IEDMS) and the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) are developing promising models for improving learner success through predictive analytics, machine learning, recommender systems (content and social), network analysis, tracking the development of concepts through social systems, discourse analysis, and intervention and support strategies. The era of data and analytics in learning is just beginning.Data, Analytics, and Learning provides an introduction to learning analytics and how it is being deployed in various contexts in education, including to support automated intervention, to inform instructors, and to pro",

We have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics, so that they will have an idea of what\u2019s possible when the time comes later in their career to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal. That said, it is not a \u201ccomputation appreciation\u201d course. Students will spend a considerable amount of time writing programs to implement the concepts covered in the course. Topics covered include plotting, stochastic programs, probability and statistics, random walks, Monte Carlo simulations, modeling data, optimization problems, and clustering.What will I learn? If you successfully complete this course, you will have:Developed some insight into the process of moving from an ambiguous problem statement to a computational formulation of a method for solving the problem,Learned a useful set of algorithmic and problem reduction techniques,Learned how to use simulations to shed light on problems that don\u2019t easily succumb to closed form solutions,Learned how to use computational tools, including simple statistical, machine learning, and plotting tools, to model and understand data.All required readings are available within the courseware, courtesy of The MIT Press.

It is not sufficient to focus on data storage and data\nanalysis. The data scientist also needs to relate data to process analysis.Process\nmining bridges the gap between traditional model-based process analysis (e.g.,\nsimulation and other business process management techniques) and data-centric\nanalysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining.Process mining\nseeks the confrontation between event data (i.e., observed behavior) and\nprocess models (hand-made or discovered automatically). This technology has\nbecome available only recently, but it can be applied to any type of operational\nprocesses (organizations and systems). Example applications include: analyzing\ntreatment processes in hospitals, improving customer service processes in a\nmultinational, understanding the browsing behavior of customers using a booking\nsite, analyzing failures of a baggage handling system, and improving the user\ninterface of an X-ray machine. All of these applications have in common that\ndynamic behavior needs to be related to process models. Hence, we refer to this\nas \"data science in action\".The course explains the key analysis\ntechniques in process mining. Participants will learn various process discovery\nalgorithms.
