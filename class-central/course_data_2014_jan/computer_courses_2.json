As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students.An optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java.I hope you enjoy the course!WHY STUDY COMPILERS?Everything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years.

Can we model the growth of internet usage in a country? Do films with a more adult rating make more money that other rated films?Luckily, the world is also full of data to help us answer those questions. This course will walk through the basics of statistical thinking \u2013 starting with an interesting question. Then, we\u2019ll learn the correct statistical tool to help answer our question of interest \u2013 using R and hands-on Labs. Finally, we\u2019ll learn how to interpret our findings and develop a meaningful conclusion.This course will consist of instructional videos for statistical concepts broken down into manageable chunks \u2013 each followed by some guided questions to help your understanding of the topic. Most weeks, the instructional section will be followed by tutorial videos for using R, which we\u2019ll then apply to a hands-on Lab where we will answer a specific question using real-world datasets.We\u2019ll cover basic Descriptive Statistics in our first \u201cUnit\u201d \u2013 learning about visualizing and summarizing data. Unit two will be a \u201cmodeling\u201d investigation where we\u2019ll learn about linear, exponential, and logistic functions. We\u2019ll learn how to interpret and use those functions with a little bit of Pre-Calculus (but we\u2019ll keep it very basic). Finally in the third Unit, we\u2019ll learn about Inferential statistical tests such as the t-test, ANOVA, and chi-square.This course is intended to have the same \u201cpunch\u201d as a typical introductory undergraduate statistics course, with an added twist of modeling. This course is also intentionally devised to be sequential, with each new piece building on the previous topics. Once completed, students should feel comfortable using basic statistical techniques to answer their own questions about their own data, using a widely available statistical software package (R).I hope you\u2019ll join me in learning how to look at the world around ",

We cover the three main programming paradigms: functional, object-oriented, and declarative dataflow.The two courses are targeted toward people with a basic knowledge of programming. It will be most useful to beginning programming students, but the unconventional approach should be insightful even to seasoned professionals.Louv1.1x (Fundamentals) covers\u00a0functional programming, its techniques and its data structures. You\u2019ll use simple formal semantics for all concepts, and see those concepts illustrated with practical code that runs on the accompanying open-source platform, the Mozart Programming System.Louv1.2x (Abstraction and Concurrency)\u00a0covers data abstraction, state, and concurrency. You\u2019ll learn the four ways to do data abstraction and discuss the trade-offs between objects and abstract data types. You\u2019ll be exposed to deterministic dataflow, the most useful paradigm for concurrent programming, and learn how it avoids race conditions.To learn more about the practical organization of the two courses,\u00a0watch the introductory video.At the end of Louv1.1x and Louv1.2x, the successful participant will be able to :Specify problems, break them down into their basic steps, and design algorithms and abstractions to solve themChoose the right programming paradigm and write a program in this paradigm to solve a problemUse formal semantics to reason about program correctnessWrite small concurrent programs in the deterministic dataflow paradigm",

This course aims to make this cutting-edge material broadly accessible to undergraduate students, including computer science majors who do not have any prior exposure to quantum mechanics. The course starts with a simple introduction to the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics using the concepts of qubits (or quantum bits) and quantum gates. This treatment emphasizes the paradoxical nature of the subject, including entanglement, non-local correlations, the no-cloning theorem and quantum teleportation. The course covers the fundamentals of quantum algorithms, including the quantum fourier transform, period finding, Shor's quantum algorithm for factoring integers, as well as the prospects for quantum algorithms for NP-complete problems. It also discusses the basic ideas behind the experimental realization of quantum computers, including the prospects for adiabatic quantum optimization and the D-Wave controversy.Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs.

As computers become more powerful, Neural Networks are gradually taking over from simpler Machine Learning methods. They are already at the heart of a new generation of speech recognition devices and they are beginning to outperform earlier systems for recognizing objects in images.

Application areas within NLP include automatic (machine) translation between languages; dialogue systems, which allow a human to interact with a machine using natural language; and information extraction, where the goal is to transform unstructured text into structured (database) representations that can be searched and browsed in flexible ways. NLP technologies are having a dramatic impact on the way people interact with computers, on the way people interact with each other through the use of language, and on the way people access the vast amount of linguistic data now in electronic form. From a scientific viewpoint, NLP involves fundamental questions of how to structure formal models (for example statistical models) of natural language phenomena, and of how to design algorithms that implement these models.In this course you will study mathematical and computational models of language, and the application of these models to key problems in natural language processing. The course has a focus on machine learning methods, which are widely used in modern NLP systems: we will cover formalisms such as hidden Markov models, probabilistic context-free grammars, log-linear models, and statistical models for machine translation. The curriculum closely follows a course currently taught by Professor Collins at Columbia University, and previously taught at MIT.SyllabusTopics covered include:1. Language modeling.2. Hidden Markov models, and tagging problems.3. Probabilistic context-free grammars, and the parsing problem.4. Statistical approaches to machine translation.5.

Probability theory gives us the basic foundation to model our beliefs about the different possible states of the world, and to update these beliefs as new evidence is obtained. These beliefs can be combined with individual preferences to help guide our actions, and even in selecting which observations to make. While probability theory has existed since the 17th century, our ability to use it effectively on large problems involving many inter-related variables is fairly recent, and is due largely to the development of a framework known as Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). This framework, which spans methods such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, uses ideas from discrete data structures in computer science to efficiently encode and manipulate probability distributions over high-dimensional spaces, often involving hundreds or even many thousands of variables. These methods have been used in an enormous range of application domains, which include: web search, medical and fault diagnosis, image understanding, reconstruction of biological networks, speech recognition, natural language processing, decoding of messages sent over a noisy communication channel, robot navigation, and many more. The PGM framework provides an essential tool for anyone who wants to learn how to reason coherently from limited and noisy observations.In this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques; you will also learn algorithms for using a PGM to reach conclusions about the world from limited and noisy evidence, and for making good decisions under uncertainty.

Machine learning (also known as data mining, pattern recognition and predictive analytics) is used widely in business, industry, science and government, and &nbsp;there is a great shortage of experts in it. If you pick up a machine learning textbook you may find it forbiddingly mathematical, but in this class you will learn that the key ideas and algorithms are in fact quite intuitive. And powerful!Most of the class will be devoted to supervised learning (in other words, learning in which a teacher provides the learner with the correct answers at training time). This is the most mature and widely used type of machine learning. We will cover the main supervised learning techniques, including decision trees, rules, instances, Bayesian techniques, neural networks, model ensembles, and support vector machines. We will also touch on learning theory with an emphasis on its practical uses. Finally, we will cover the two main classes of unsupervised learning methods: clustering and dimensionality reduction. Throughout the class there will be an emphasis not just on individual algorithms but on ideas that cut across them and tips for making them work.In the class projects you will build your own implementations of machine learning algorithms and apply them to problems like spam filtering, clickstream mining, recommender systems, and computational biology. This will get you as close to becoming a machine learning expert as you can in ten weeks!SyllabusWeek One: Basic concepts in machine learning.Week Two: Decision tree induction.Week Three: Learning sets of rules and logic programs.Week Four: Instance-based learning.Week Five: Statistical learning.Week Six: Neural networks.Week Seven: Model ensembles.Week Eight: Learning theory.Week Nine: Support vector machines.Week Ten: Clustering and dimensionalit",

Nous\nverrons ensuite comment planifier une ville \"int\u00e9grative\", ouverte,\nrespectueuse de l\u2019environnement et faiblement consommatrice en ressources.Parall\u00e8lement, nous aborderons\nla question du financement des villes, le jeu des acteurs (gouvernance) et l\u2019\u00e9valuation des planifications.L\u2019entr\u00e9e du cours n\u2019est\npas disciplinaire, mais th\u00e9matique.

After a short overview of the big urban issues (climate change, energy,\nright to the city, land, habitat\u2026), we will tackle the tools currently used in\nplanning and will have a critical reading. We will then see how to plan an\nintegrative, open, environmental-friendly and low-resource-consumption city.In parallel, we will approach the funding of the cities, the\ngovernance and the assessment of the planning.The approach of the course is not disciplinary, rather thematic.\nThe course articulates the different reading levels of the city (technical,\nsocial and symbolic) as well as urban issues allowing to highlight the making of a city.SyllabusSemaine 1&nbsp;:Introduction \u00e0 la ville\nafricaine et \u00e0 la planification (partie 1) /&nbsp;Week 1&nbsp;: Introduction\nto the African city and planningPr\u00e9sentation\ndu cours&nbsp;; L'urbanisation en Afrique: les\nchangements et les d\u00e9fis&nbsp;; Qu'est-ce que la\nplanification urbaine et pourquoi planifier&nbsp;?&nbsp;; De l'urbanisation\n\u00e0 la ville africaine.Presentation\nof the course ; African urbanization&nbsp;: changes and",

        "desc": "This course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers, including lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees, types and type checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis, program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems. As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students.An optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java.I hope you enjoy the course!WHY STUDY COMPILERS?Everything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years.

Can we model the growth of internet usage in a country? Do films with a more adult rating make more money that other rated films?Luckily, the world is also full of data to help us answer those questions. This course will walk through the basics of statistical thinking \u2013 starting with an interesting question. Then, we\u2019ll learn the correct statistical tool to help answer our question of interest \u2013 using R and hands-on Labs. Finally, we\u2019ll learn how to interpret our findings and develop a meaningful conclusion.This course will consist of instructional videos for statistical concepts broken down into manageable chunks \u2013 each followed by some guided questions to help your understanding of the topic. Most weeks, the instructional section will be followed by tutorial videos for using R, which we\u2019ll then apply to a hands-on Lab where we will answer a specific question using real-world datasets.We\u2019ll cover basic Descriptive Statistics in our first \u201cUnit\u201d \u2013 learning about visualizing and summarizing data. Unit two will be a \u201cmodeling\u201d investigation where we\u2019ll learn about linear, exponential, and logistic functions. We\u2019ll learn how to interpret and use those functions with a little bit of Pre-Calculus (but we\u2019ll keep it very basic). Finally in the third Unit, we\u2019ll learn about Inferential statistical tests such as the t-test, ANOVA, and chi-square.This course is intended to have the same \u201cpunch\u201d as a typical introductory undergraduate statistics course, with an added twist of modeling. This course is also intentionally devised to be sequential, with each new piece building on the previous topics. Once completed, students should feel comfortable using basic statistical techniques to answer their own questions about their own data, using a widely available statistical software package (R).I hope you\u2019ll join me in learning how to look at the world around ",

We cover the three main programming paradigms: functional, object-oriented, and declarative dataflow.The two courses are targeted toward people with a basic knowledge of programming. It will be most useful to beginning programming students, but the unconventional approach should be insightful even to seasoned professionals.Louv1.1x (Fundamentals) covers\u00a0functional programming, its techniques and its data structures. You\u2019ll use simple formal semantics for all concepts, and see those concepts illustrated with practical code that runs on the accompanying open-source platform, the Mozart Programming System.Louv1.2x (Abstraction and Concurrency)\u00a0covers data abstraction, state, and concurrency. You\u2019ll learn the four ways to do data abstraction and discuss the trade-offs between objects and abstract data types. You\u2019ll be exposed to deterministic dataflow, the most useful paradigm for concurrent programming, and learn how it avoids race conditions.To learn more about the practical organization of the two courses,\u00a0watch the introductory video.At the end of Louv1.1x and Louv1.2x, the successful participant will be able to :Specify problems, break them down into their basic steps, and design algorithms and abstractions to solve themChoose the right programming paradigm and write a program in this paradigm to solve a problemUse formal semantics to reason about program correctnessWrite small concurrent programs in the deterministic dataflow paradigm",

This course aims to make this cutting-edge material broadly accessible to undergraduate students, including computer science majors who do not have any prior exposure to quantum mechanics. The course starts with a simple introduction to the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics using the concepts of qubits (or quantum bits) and quantum gates. This treatment emphasizes the paradoxical nature of the subject, including entanglement, non-local correlations, the no-cloning theorem and quantum teleportation. The course covers the fundamentals of quantum algorithms, including the quantum fourier transform, period finding, Shor's quantum algorithm for factoring integers, as well as the prospects for quantum algorithms for NP-complete problems. It also discusses the basic ideas behind the experimental realization of quantum computers, including the prospects for adiabatic quantum optimization and the D-Wave controversy.Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs.

As computers become more powerful, Neural Networks are gradually taking over from simpler Machine Learning methods. They are already at the heart of a new generation of speech recognition devices and they are beginning to outperform earlier systems for recognizing objects in images.

Application areas within NLP include automatic (machine) translation between languages; dialogue systems, which allow a human to interact with a machine using natural language; and information extraction, where the goal is to transform unstructured text into structured (database) representations that can be searched and browsed in flexible ways. NLP technologies are having a dramatic impact on the way people interact with computers, on the way people interact with each other through the use of language, and on the way people access the vast amount of linguistic data now in electronic form. From a scientific viewpoint, NLP involves fundamental questions of how to structure formal models (for example statistical models) of natural language phenomena, and of how to design algorithms that implement these models.In this course you will study mathematical and computational models of language, and the application of these models to key problems in natural language processing. The course has a focus on machine learning methods, which are widely used in modern NLP systems: we will cover formalisms such as hidden Markov models, probabilistic context-free grammars, log-linear models, and statistical models for machine translation. The curriculum closely follows a course currently taught by Professor Collins at Columbia University, and previously taught at MIT.SyllabusTopics covered include:1. Language modeling.2. Hidden Markov models, and tagging problems.3. Probabilistic context-free grammars, and the parsing problem.4. Statistical approaches to machine translation.5.

Probability theory gives us the basic foundation to model our beliefs about the different possible states of the world, and to update these beliefs as new evidence is obtained. These beliefs can be combined with individual preferences to help guide our actions, and even in selecting which observations to make. While probability theory has existed since the 17th century, our ability to use it effectively on large problems involving many inter-related variables is fairly recent, and is due largely to the development of a framework known as Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). This framework, which spans methods such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, uses ideas from discrete data structures in computer science to efficiently encode and manipulate probability distributions over high-dimensional spaces, often involving hundreds or even many thousands of variables. These methods have been used in an enormous range of application domains, which include: web search, medical and fault diagnosis, image understanding, reconstruction of biological networks, speech recognition, natural language processing, decoding of messages sent over a noisy communication channel, robot navigation, and many more. The PGM framework provides an essential tool for anyone who wants to learn how to reason coherently from limited and noisy observations.In this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques; you will also learn algorithms for using a PGM to reach conclusions about the world from limited and noisy evidence, and for making good decisions under uncertainty.

This course aims to make this cutting-edge material broadly accessible to undergraduate students, including computer science majors who do not have any prior exposure to quantum mechanics. The course starts with a simple introduction to the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics using the concepts of qubits (or quantum bits) and quantum gates. This treatment emphasizes the paradoxical nature of the subject, including entanglement, non-local correlations, the no-cloning theorem and quantum teleportation. The course covers the fundamentals of quantum algorithms, including the quantum fourier transform, period finding, Shor's quantum algorithm for factoring integers, as well as the prospects for quantum algorithms for NP-complete problems.",

More importantly, you\u2019ll start to learn computational thinking, which is a fundamental approach to solving real-world problems. Computer programming languages share common fundamental concepts, and this course will introduce you to those concepts using the Python programming language.

They study patterns of behavior to know what someone will \nprefer from among a collection of things he has never experienced. The \ntechnology behind recommender systems has evolved over the past 20 years\n into a rich collection of tools that enable the practitioner or \nresearcher to develop effective recommenders. We will study the most \nimportant of those tools, including how they work, how to use them, how \nto evaluate them, and their strengths and weaknesses in practice.The\n algorithms we will study include content-based filtering, user-user \ncollaborative filtering, item-item collaborative filtering, dimensionality \nreduction, and interactive critique-based recommenders.

This means that being able to design programs\n    - or at least be able to work with people who design programs - is becoming\n    a more and more valuable skill.To build your own programs you need to know two things: how to use the\n    specific programming language and libraries needed, and the more general\n    skill of how to design a program.This course presents adesign methodthat will enable you to approach\n    the design of complex programs systematically. The method will work for\n    programs in this course as well as hard to design programs you develop\n    in the future.Using this method you will learn how to model the information in a problem\n    domain, how to structure program data to mirror that information and how\n    to further structure the data to lead to a well organized program. You\n    will also learn to distinguish those parts of a program that are naturally\n    data driven, from those that should use an alternative algorithmic approach.\n    The method uses unit-tests to both produce a better developed design, and\n    to test your program as you develop it.In the first course -- Part 1 -- we use a simple\n    teaching language to cover the core of the design method. In Part 1 we cover various forms of data; simple interactive programs like games and animations; storing information in and rendering trees; and finally exploring search programs: programs that solve puzzles like Sudoku boards.&nbsp;A second phase of the course, to be offered later, &nbsp;will consist of parallel tracks, with each track using a different popular\n    programming language and focusing on a different kind of problem.

What is the logical relationship among data?\n    How are the data stored in computers? What algorithms should be operated to solve the problems on the data? These are the questions that will be answered in \u201cData Structures and Algorithms\u201d, one of the most important core courses in Computer Science.\n    The course also covers fundamental data structures and classical algorithms which are widely used in the&nbsp;succeeding specialized courses,&nbsp;such as Operating Systems, Software Engineering, Database Systems, Compiler&nbsp;Principles, Computer\n    Graphics and Human Computer Interaction.What is the combination of data structures and algorithms? Niklaus Wirth wrote a book titled \"Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs\", which points out their important roles in computing discipline:&nbsp;algorithm and data structure are two closely linked\n    and indivisible parts of programming.The course will follow the idea of&nbsp; \u201cAlgorithms + Data",

Stories about\n    companies or scientists using data to recommend movies, discover who is\n    pregnant based on credit card receipts, or confirm the existence of the\n    Higgs Boson regularly appear in Forbes, the Economist, the Wall Street\n    Journal, and The New York Times. But how does one turn data into this type\n    of insight? The answer is data analysis and applied statistics. Data analysis\n    is the process of finding the right data to answer your question, understanding\n    the processes underlying the data, discovering the important patterns in\n    the data, and then communicating your results to have the biggest possible\n    impact. There is a critical shortage of people with these skills in the\n    workforce, which is why Hal Varian (Chief Economist at Google) says that\n    being a statistician will be the sexy job for the next 10 years.This course is an applied statistics course focusing on data analysis.\n    The course will begin with an overview of how to organize, perform, and\n    write-up data analyses. Then we will cover some of the most popular and\n    widely used statistical methods like linear regression, principal components\n    analysis, cross-validation, and p-values. Instead of focusing on mathematical\n    details, the lectures will be designed to help you apply these techniques\n    to real data using the R statistical programming language, interpret the\n    results, and diagnose potential problems in your analysis. You will also\n    have the opportunity to critique and assist your fellow classmates with\n    their data analyses.",

Reactive programming is an emerging discipline which combines concurrency and event-based and asynchronous systems. It is essential for writing any kind of web-service or distributed system and is also at the core of many high-performance concurrent systems. Reactive programming can be seen as a natural extension of higher-order functional programming to concurrent systems that deal with distributed state&nbsp;by coordinating and orchestrating asynchronous data streams exchanged by actors.In this course you will discover key elements for writing reactive programs in a composable way. You will find out how to apply these building blocks in the construction of event-driven systems that are scalable and resilient.The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series of assignments, which are also programming projects.Personalized Tutoring by Typesafe: Typesafe offers supervised tutorial sessions accompanying select Coursera classes. In weekly, one-hour tutorial sessions experts from Typesafe provide in-depth answers to questions about the course material, and discuss solutions to homework assignments past the deadline. Tutorial groups are small (10 participants max) in order to meet individual mentoring needs as much as possible. Tutorial session slots are offered in both European and American time zones.Registration for tutoring by Typesafe is open.SyllabusWeek 1: Review of Principles of Functional Programming: substitution model, for-expressions and how they relate to monads.",

Certain features of this course may not be active, but many people enjoy watching the videos and working with the materials. Make sure to check for reruns of this course.\nThis course gives an introduction to all major programming concepts, techniques, and paradigms in a unified framework. We cover the three main programming paradigms: functional, object-oriented, and declarative dataflow. We explain the four ways to do data abstraction and discuss the trade-offs between objects and abstract data types. We present declarative dataflow, the most useful paradigm for concurrent programming, and show how it avoids race conditions. We give a simple formal semantics for all concepts and illustrate them with practical code that runs on the accompanying open-source platform, the Mozart Programming System. This course is targeted toward people with a basic knowledge of programming. It will be most useful to beginning programming students, but the unconventional approach should be insightful even to seasoned professionals.\nTo learn more about the practical organization of the course, watch our second introductory video: http://youtu.be/M0Dlswd_hIQ\nAll required readings are available within the courseware, courtesy of The MIT Press.

The learner is assumed to have no prior experience of programming, but is expected to be at the level of a second year undergraduate college student in science or engineering. The course will run over ten weeks with about 2-3 hours of lectures per week.At the end of each week, the learner is expected to write some programs and submit them for grading. These programming problems are classified as easy, moderate or difficult. The easy problems, typically, are repeats from the lecture. The moderate and difficult ones will require increasing levels of initiative from the learner.&nbsp;In addition, at the end of each week the learner is expected to answer a set of objective-type assessment questions.&nbsp;SyllabusIntroduction to Computers and ProgrammingWriting your first programVariables and operators and expressionsVariable declarations, more operators, precedenceInput, Output StatementsConditionalsLoopsArrays and Multidimensional arraysPointersFunctionsRunning time of a programComputing time complexityPolynomial evaluation and multiplicationSearching: Linear and BinaryFinding minimum and maximumSorting I: Insertion, MergeSorting II: Counting, RadixFinding i-th smallest numberStructures and User-defined data typesBrief introduction to C++: Classes and objectsData Structures: Abstract Data TypeListsStacks: Last In First OutQueues: First In First OutTreesTree traversalHeapsGraphs and RepresentationGreedy algorithmsDynamic programmingMatrix Chain MultiplicationDijkstra's AlgorithmStringsBoyer-Moore String Matching AlgorithmFile I/OModular Programming",

How does it affect our democratic institutions? Do you know that the metadata collected by a cellular network speaks volumes about its users? In this course you will explore all of these questions while investigating related issues in WiFi and Internet surveillance. The issues explored in this course are at the intersection of networking technology, law, and sociology and will appeal to anyone interested in the technical, political, and moral questions inherent in the use of information networks. The course will include broad overviews for the novice, while pointing to the detailed resources needed for those engaged in the development of corporate or governmental policies.",

As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students.An optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java.I hope you enjoy the course!Why Study Compilers?Everything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years.

Its contents are heavily influenced by the idea that data analysis\nshould help in enhancing and augmenting knowledge of the domain as represented\nby the concepts and statements of relation between them. According to this\nview, two main pathways for data analysis are summarization, for developing and\naugmenting concepts, and correlation, for enhancing and establishing relations.\nThe term summarization embraces here both simple summaries like totals and\nmeans and more complex summaries: the principal\ncomponents of a set of features and cluster structures in a set of entities.\nSimilarly, correlation covers both bivariate and multivariate relations between\ninput and target features including Bayes classifiers.The view of the data as a subject of\ncomputational data analysis that is adhered to here has emerged quite recently.\nTypically, in sciences and in statistics, a problem comes first, and then the\ninvestigator turns to data that might be useful in advancing towards a\nsolution. Yet nowadays the situation is reversed frequently, especially with\nthe advent of Big Data. Typical questions then are: Take a look at this data\nset - what sense can be made out of it? \u2013 Is there any structure in the data\nset? Can these features help in predicting those? This is more reminiscent to a\ntraveler\u2019s view of the world rather than that of a scientist.

Despite many improvements in processors, storage, and networks, however, developing quality software on-time and on-budget remains hard. Moreover,\n    developing high qualityreusableconcurrent and&nbsp;networked software apps and services is even harder. &nbsp;The principles, methods, and&nbsp;skills required to develop such software are best learned by&nbsp;attaining mastery of&nbsp;patterns,pattern languages,\n    andframeworks.Apattern&nbsp;describes a reusable solution to a common problem that arises within a particular context.

        "desc": "This course introduces acoustics by using the concept of impedance. It starts with vibrations and waves, demonstrating how vibrations can be envisaged as a kind of wave, mathematically and physically. The essential measures for acoustic waves, such as dB scale, octave scale, acoustic pressure, energy, intensity, will also be explained. These measures are realized by one-dimensional examples, which provide clear and simple physical insights.The course then moves on to explaining waves on a flat surface of discontinuity, demonstrating how propagation characteristics of waves change in space where there is a distributed impedance mismatch.&nbsp;Subsequent topics are radiation, scattering, and diffraction, which can be explained in a unified way by seeing the changes of waves due to spatially distributed impedance. Lastly, the course covers sound in closed space, which is considered to be a space that is surrounded by spatially distributed impedance, and introduces two spaces: acoustically large and small space. In Part 1, we will handle topics from vibrations and waves to waves on a flat surface of discontinuity. The later&nbsp;parts will be&nbsp;covered in Part 2.This course is for graduate students and advanced undergraduates in acoustics, audio engineering, and noise control engineering. Practicing engineers and researchers in audio engineering and noise control, or students in engineering and physics disciplines, who want to gain an understanding of sound and vibration concepts, are also welcome.SyllabusWeek 1: Vibration &amp; WavesHow are time and space&nbsp;related? What about the relation between frequency and wavelength?Does the characteristic impedance of medium determine reflection and transmission?Do we well see the waves of a string in terms of driving point impedance?&nbsp;Week 2: Acoustics Wave Equation and Its Basic Physical Measures(1D acoustic wave equation, Acoustic Intensity and Energy, Units of Sound)What are&nbsp;the relations of acoustic pressure,",

We will discuss the game of baseball, not through consensus or a fan\u2019s conventional wisdom, but by searching for objective knowledge in hitting, pitching, and fielding performance. These and other areas of sabermetrics will be analyzed and better understood with current and historical baseball data.The course also serves as applied introduction to the basics of data science, a growing field of scholarship, that requires skills in computation, statistics, and communicating results of analyses. Using baseball data, the basics of statistical regression, the R Language, and SQL will be covered.This course has been successfully taught at the Experimental College at Tufts University since 2004. Many of its former students have gone on to careers writing about baseball and working in various MLB baseball operations and analytics departments.Professor Andres talks about the science of baseball: The Science of the Home Run, TedXYouth@Beacon Street.",

People from many different backgrounds now want to understand the basics of programming, because it&rsquo;s both fun and an increasingly valuable skill. One of the most exciting ways to learn programming is through authoring your own creative programs. Known as &ldquo;creative coding&rdquo;, this growing field uses computer software as a medium to develop original creative expression. So if you&rsquo;re an artist, designer, architect or musician who&rsquo;s interested in how you can expand your creative skills, or even a computer programmer looking to work in creative applications, you will find this course extremely useful.Throughout the course we&rsquo;ll help you develop practical programming concepts and skills by exploring creative ideas and challenges. We&rsquo;ll be looking at the history and philosophy behind artistic uses of technology, so you can gain a greater understanding of how best to express your own creative vision using the software you write. The aim is to teach you &ldquo;algorithmic thinking&rdquo; &ndash; ways to conceptualise and model the world so you can express creative ideas using computer programs. A background in programming is not assumed or necessary.Each week we will start with a simple creative idea and guide you through turning that idea into a working computer program. We&rsquo;ll be exploring programs that can generate images, animations and sound and you&rsquo;ll learn how you can interact with them to change their behaviour. As you&rsquo;ll discover, this opens a world of possibilities, because as you expand and modify your program new creative possibilities emerge. Starting with simple processes we will look at how to create increasingly complex and nuanced visual and sonic artworks using generative programming techniques. Assignments will give you the opportunity to explore your own creative ideas and share your achievements with fellow stu",

You'll learn several techniques for rapidly prototyping and evaluating multiple interface alternatives -- and why rapid prototyping and comparative evaluation are essential to excellent interaction design. You'll learn how to conduct fieldwork with people to help you get design ideas. How to make paper prototypes and low-fidelity mock-ups that are interactive -- and how to use these designs to get feedback from other stakeholders like your teammates, clients, and users. You'll learn principles of visual design so that you can effectively organize and present information with your interfaces. You'll learn principles of perception and cognition that inform effective interaction design. And you'll learn how to perform and analyze controlled experiments online. In many cases, we'll use Web design as the anchoring domain. A lot of the examples will come from the Web, and we'll talk just a bit about Web technologies in particular. When we do so, it will be to support the main goal of this course, which is helping you build human-centered design skills, so that you have the principles and methods to create excellent interfaces with any technology.",

Those who successfully complete the course will receive a statement of accomplishment. You will need a decent Internet connection for accessing course materials, but should be able to watch the videos on your smartphone.The course covers four broad areas: (1) Finite automata and regular expressions, (2) Context-free grammars, (3) Turing machines and decidability, and (4) the theory of intractability, or NP-complete problems.Why Study Automata Theory?This subject is not just for those planning to enter the field of complexity theory, although it is a good place to start if that is your goal. Rather, the course will emphasize those aspects of the theory that people really use in practice. Finite automata, regular expressions, and context-free grammars are ideas that have stood the test of time. They are essential tools for compilers. But more importantly, they are used in many systems that require input that is less general than a full programming language yet more complex than \"push this button.\"The concepts of undecidable problems and intractable problems serve a different purpose. Undecidable problems are those for which no computer solution can ever exist, while intractable problems are those for which there is strong evidence that, although they can be solved by a computer, they cannot be solved sufficiently fast that the solution is truly useful in practice. Understanding this theory, and in particular being able to prove that a problem you are facing belongs to one of these classes, allows you to justify taking another approach \u2014 simplifying the problem or writing code to approximate the solution, for example.During",

        "desc": "The ability to reason is fundamental to human beings. Whatever the discipline or discourse it is important to be able to distinguish correct reasoning from incorrect reasoning. The consequences of incorrect reasoning can be minor, like getting lost on the way to a birthday party, or more significant, for example launching nuclear missiles at a flock of ducks, or permanently losing contact with a space craft.The fundamental question that we will address in this course is \"when does one statement necessarily follow from another\" --- or in the terminology of the course, \"when is one statement a&nbsp;logical consequence&nbsp;of another\". This is an issue of some importance, since an answer to the question would allow us to examine an argument presented in a blog, for example, and to decide whether it really demonstrates the truth of the conclusion of the argument. Our own reasoning might also improve, since we would also be able to analyze our own arguments to see whether they really do demonstrate their conclusions.In this course you will be introduced to the concepts and techniques used in logic. We will start right from the beginning, assuming no prior exposure to this or similar material, and progress through discussions of the proof and model theories of propositional and first-order logic.We will proceed by giving a theory of truth, and of logical consequence, based on a formal language called FOL (the language of First-Order Logic). We adopt a formal language for making statements, since natural languages (like English, for example) are far too vague and ambiguous for us to analyze sufficiently. Armed with the formal language, we will be able to model the notions of truth, proof and consequence, among others.While logic is technical in nature, the key concepts in the course will be developed by considering natural English statements, and we will focus the relationships between such statements and their FOL counterparts. The goal of the course is to show how natur",

What is the logical relationship among data? How is data stored in computers? What algorithms are required to solve particular problems? These are the questions that will be answered in \u201cData Structures and Algorithms,\u201d an important core course in Computer Science. The course also introduces students to fundamental data structures and classical algorithms used in more specialized courses,\u00a0including Operating Systems, Software Engineering, Database Systems, Compiler\u00a0Principles, Computer Graphics and Human Computer Interaction.Niklaus Wirth described the important and indivisible link between algorithms and data structure in his book, Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs.The course will build on Wirth\u2019s ideas as it helps students improve their knowledge of theory and their ability to think abs",

        "desc": "You pick up your iPhone while waiting in line at a coffee shop. You google a not-so-famous actor, get linked to a Wikipedia entry listing his recent movies and popular YouTube clips of several of them. You check out user reviews on Amazon and pick one,\ndownload that movie on BitTorrent or stream that in Netflix. But suddenly the WiFi logo on your phone is gone and you're on 3G. Video quality starts to degrade, but you don't know if it's the server getting crowded or the Internet is congested somewhere.\nIn any case, it costs you $10 per Gigabyte, and you decide to stop watching the movie, and instead multitask between sending tweets and calling your friend on Skype, while songs stream from iCloud to your phone. You're happy with the call quality, but\nget a little irritated when you see there're no new followers on Twitter. You may wonder how they all kind of work, and why sometimes they don't. Take a look at the list of 20 questions below. Each question is selected not just for its relevance to our\ndaily lives, but also for the core concepts in the field of networking illustrated by its answers. This course is about formulating and answering some of these 20 questions.SyllabusWhat makes CDMA work for my smartphone?How does Google rank webpages?How does Netflix recommend movies?Why do AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless charge me $10 a GB?How does traffic get through the Internet?Why doesn't the Internet collapse under congestion?Why is WiFi faster at home than at a hotspot?",

        "desc": "This course introduces the cornerstones of functional programming using the Scala programming language. Functional programming has become more and more popular in recent years because it promotes code that\u2019s safe, concise, and elegant. Furthermore, functional programming makes it easier to write parallel code for today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s multiprocessors by replacing mutable variables and loops with powerful ways to define and compose functions.Scala is a language that fuses functional and object-oriented programming in a practical package. It interoperates seamlessly with Java and its tools. Scala is now used in a rapidly increasing number of open source projects and companies. It provides the core infrastructure for sites such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare, Tumblr, and Klout.In this course you will discover the elements of the functional programming style and learn how to apply them usefully in your daily programming tasks. You will also develop a solid foundation for reasoning about functional programs, by touching upon proofs of invariants and the tracing of execution symbolically.The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series of assignments, most of which are also programming projects.SyllabusWeek One:Programming paradigms; overview of functional programming and the Scala programming language.Week Two:Defining and using functions, recursion and non-termination, working with functions as values, reasoning by reduction.Week Three:Defining and using immutable objects, review of inheritance and dynamic binding.Week Four:Types and Pattern MatchingWeek Five:Working with ListsWeek Six:Collections and Combinatorial SearchWeek Seven:Lazy Evaluation",

        "desc": "This course is designed to help students with very little or no computing background learn the basics of building simple interactive applications.  Our language of choice, Python, is an easy-to learn, high-level computer language that is used in many of the computational courses offered on Coursera.  To make learning Python easy, we have developed a new browser-based programming environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple.  These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse.The primary method for learning the course material will be to work through multiple \"mini-projects\" in Python.  To make this class enjoyable, these projects will include building fun games such as Pong, Blackjack, and Asteroids. When you\u2019ve finished our course, we can\u2019t promise that you will be a professional programmer, but we think that you will learn a lot about programming in Python and have fun while you\u2019re doing it.SyllabusOur course syllabus can be seen atwww.codeskulptor.org/coursera/interactivepython.html.",

Building on a computer organization base, this course explores techniques that go into designing a modern microprocessor. Fundamental understanding of computer architecture is key not only for students interested in hardware and processor design, but is a foundation for students interested in compilers, operating systems, and high performance programming. This course will explore how the computer architect can utilize the increasing number of transistors available to improve the performance of a processor. Focus will be given to architectures that can exploit different forms of parallelism, whether they be implicit or explicit. This course covers architectural techniques such as multi-issue superscalar processors, out-of-order processors, Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) processors, advanced caching, and multiprocessor systems.",

        "desc": "Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being\n    explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us\n    self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search,\n    and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning\n    is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without\n    knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress\n    towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective\n    machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting\n    them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only\n    the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical\n    know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new\n    problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices\n    in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining,\n    and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning\n    (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels,\n    neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality\n    reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in\n    machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning\n    and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications,\n    so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building\n    smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam),\n    computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other\n    areas.",

Certain features of this course may not be active, but many people enjoy watching the videos and working with the materials. Make sure to check for reruns of this course.Louv1.1x\u00a0(starting Sep. 22, 2014) and Louv1.2x (coming in Nov. 2014) together give an introduction to all major programming concepts, techniques, and paradigms in a unified framework. We cover the three main programming paradigms : functional, object-oriented, and declarative dataflow.The two courses are targeted toward people with a basic knowledge of programming. It will be most useful to beginning programming students, but the unconventional approach should be insightful even to seasoned professionals.Louv1.1x covers fundamental concepts. You\u2019ll learn functional programming, its techniques and its data structures. You\u2019ll use simple formal semantics for all concepts, and see those concepts illustrated with practical code that runs on the accompanying open-source platform, the Mozart Programming System.Louv1.2x covers data abstraction, state, and concurrency. You\u2019ll learn the four ways to do data abstraction and discuss the trade-offs between objects and abstract data types. You\u2019ll be exposed to deterministic dataflow, the most useful paradigm for concurrent programming, and learn how it avoids race conditions.To learn more about the practical organization of the two courses, watch the introductory video.At the end of Louv1.1x and Louv1.2x, the successful participant will be able to :Specify problems, break them down into their basic steps, and design algorithms and abstractions to solve themChoose the right programming paradigm and write a program in this paradigm to solve a problemUse formal semantics to reason about program correctnessWrite small concurrent programs in the deterministic dataflow paradigm",

Thanks to spatial computing, a hiker in Yellowstone and a taxi driver in Manhattan can know precisely where\n    they are, discover nearby points of interest and learn how to reach their destinations. Spatial computing technology is what powers the Foursquare check-in, the maps app on your smartphone, the devices used by scientists to track endangered species,\n    the routing directions that help you get from point A to point B, the precision agriculture technology that is revolutionizing farming, and the augmented reality devices like Google Glass that may soon mediate our interaction with the real world.This course introduces the fundamental ideas underlying spatial computing services, systems, and sciences. Topics covered will include the nature of geospatial information, proper statistical frameworks for working with geospatial data, key algorithms\n    and data structures, spatial data mining, and cartography/geovisualization. We will also address applied topics such as where to find spatial data, how to use powerful open source software to analyze and map spatial data, and frameworks for building\n    location-based services.Three Ways to Enjoy this Course:This course is designed to support three different types of students and educational goals:Curiosity Track: Most of us interact with spatial technologies every day. This track is for students who wish to learn about one or two spatial computing topics, but not commit to an entire course. Curiosity track students are not interested in\n    a certificate of accomplishment.Concepts Track: This track is for students who want to learn about spatial computing concepts in order to make informed choices, but who are not programmers and do not have extensive experience with statistical methods.

If you can understand the following descriptions of this course, you can probably follow the slides.[\u6b61\u8fce\u5927\u5bb6\uff01\u9019\u9580\u8ab2\u5c07\u63a1\u7528\u82f1\u6587\u6295\u5f71\u7247\u914d\u5408\u83ef\u6587\u7684\u6559\u5b78\u8b1b\u89e3\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u85c9\u9019\u6b21\u83ef\u6587\u6559\u5b78\u7684\u6a5f\u6703\uff0c\u5c07\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u4ecb\u7d39\u7d66\u66f4\u591a\u83ef\u4eba\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5165\u9580\u8005\u3002\u8ab2\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u82f1\u6587\u6295\u5f71\u7247\u4e0d\u6703\u4f7f\u7528\u5230\u8271\u6df1\u7684\u82f1\u6587\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u80fd\u4e86\u89e3\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5169\u6bb5\u7684\u8ab2\u7a0b\u7c21\u4ecb\uff0c\u4f60\u61c9\u8a72\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u8ab2\u7a0b\u6240\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u82f1\u6587\u6295\u5f71\u7247\u3002]Machine learning is an exciting field with lots of applications in engineering, science, finance, and commerce. It is also a very dynamic field, where many new techniques are being designed every day, and the hot techniques and theories at times can rise and disappear rapidly. Thus, users of machine learning from other fields often face the problem of choosing or using the techniques properly. In this course, we emphasize the necessary fundamentals that give any student of machine learning a \nsolid foundation, and enable him or her to exploit current techniques properly, explore \nfurther techniques and theories, or perhaps to contribute their own in the future.The course roughly corresponds to the first half-semester of the National Taiwan University course \"Machine Learning\", and the second half-semester is expected to be on Coursera under the name \"Machine Learning Techniques\" soon in the future. Based on five years of teaching this popular course successfully (including winning the most prestigious teaching award of National Taiwan University) and discussing with many other scholars actively, the instructor chooses to focus on what he believes to be the core topics that every student of the subject should know. The students shall enjoy a story-like flow moving from \"When Can Machines Learn\" to \"Why\", \"How\" and beyond.SyllabusEach of the following items correspond to approximately ",
