Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them. \u00a0The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available. This course will focus on literate statistical analysis tools which allow one to publish data analyses in a single document that allows others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results.SyllabusIn this course you will learn to write a document using R markdown, integrate live R code into a literate statistical program, compile R markdown documents using knitr and related tools, and organize a data analysis so that it is reproducible and accessible to others.",

Images and videos are everywhere, from those we take with our mobile devices and share with our friends to those that we receive from Mars and the ones we see in the movie theatre, without forgetting the whole ensemble of images of our bodies that are taken in hospital visits. Image and video processing is the art of working with such images and movies, from making it possible to store and transmit them to making those dark and blurry images look nice, as well as interpreting and analyzing the medical data and recognizing our friends\u2019 faces in social pictures. This discipline is also fascinating because it uses tools from many areas of applied mathematics. In this class you will look behind the scenes of image and video processing, from the basic and classical tools to the most modern and advanced algorithms.The course will start with an introduction to the basics of image formation and the fundamental concepts that translate a physical scene into a digital image. We will then describe the underlying concepts of image compression, the enabling technology that makes it possible for images to be sent from Mars and videos to be stored in our mobile phones. We will cover the most fundamental tools in image enhancement, showing how simple tools can significantly improve images. Both geometric and non-geometric tools as well as spatial and non-spatial operations will be presented. Details on image segmentation will be provided, one of the most fundamental and useful problems in image processing. The above topics will be extended to color images and video. Once we have covered the fundamentals, which both provide the basis for modern image and video processing and serve many important applications until today, we will move into recent progress in the area, covering image inpainting (how to remove objects from images and video), image processing via sparse modeling and compressed sensing, geometric partial differential equations for image",

With all types of dedicated hardware/circuits, known as co-processors, being developed to speed up application specific computations, hardware\u2019s role changes from the enabler to an enhancer. Nowadays, hardware becomes the enforcer for secure systems because it is used to ensure that only the authenticated user and software can access the processor. However, current hardware design flow does not have security as a key design objective. Consequently, we will conduct several case studies where hardware turns into the weakest link in secure systems.Then we will review the fundamentals of digital logic design and use this as an example to analyze the source of security vulnerabilities and demonstrate how these vulnerabilities can become legitimate security threats.

Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. Some of the people taking the two courses will use them as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses, but for many it will be their first and last computer science courses.Since these courses may be the only formal computer science courses many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, they are not \"computation appreciation\" courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will.Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python covers the notion of computation, the Python programming language, some simple algorithms, testing and debugging, and informal introduction to algorithmic complexity, and some simple algorithms and data structures.Recommended textbook.\u00a0The recommended textbook for this course is: Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python, Revised and Expanded edition, by John Guttag (MIT Press, 2013).

Latest hardware and software trends led to the development of a new revolutionary database technology that enables flexible and lightning-fast analysis of massive amounts of enterprise data. The basic concepts and design principles of this technology are explained in detail. Beyond that, the implications of the underlying design principles for future enterprise applications and their development are discussed. The course will explain in detail the differences and advantages of an in-memory column-oriented database in contrast to traditional row-oriented disk-based storages. The following topics are covered (among others):Requirements for Modern Enterprise Computing, Enterprise Application CharacteristicsHardware Trends, Columnar Storage vs. Row StorageDictionary Encoding, CompressionScans, Selects, Deletes, Inserts, UpdatesIndices, JoinsApplicationsSyllabusWeek 1:The first week will give you an understanding of origins of enterprise computing. It is vital to know the historic development which lead to the emergence of current hardware as we know it now in order to understand the decisions made in the past. Many characteristics of current applications, like materialized aggregates and a reduction of detail in the stored information, have their roots in the past. While these measures were helpful in former systems, they form an obstacle which has to be overcome now in order to allow for new, dynamic applications.Week 2:Within the second week, the differences between a horizontal, row oriented layout and a columnar layout are discussed. Concepts like compression and partitioning are introduced. Based on that, you will get an explanation of the internal steps performed inside the database to carry out the fundamental relational operations insert, update and delete.

Besides plain texts, especially multimedia information such as graphics, audio or video have become a predominant part of the web's information traffic. But, how can we find useful information within this huge information space? Traditional search engines will reach the limits of their power, when it comes to understanding information content. The Semantic Web is an extension of the traditional web in the sense that information in the form of natural language text in the web will be complemented by its explicit semantics based on a formal knowledge representation. Thus, the meaning of information expressed in natural language can be accessed in an automated way and interpreted correctly, i.e. it can be understood by machines.Semantic Web technologies enable the explicit representation of knowledge and its further processing to deduce new knowledge from implicitly hidden knowledge. Thus, information access and information search will be more precise and more complete compared to today's traditional information retrieval technology. Previously heterogeneous data can be mapped and combined based on common knowledge representation and schemata easily extended in a dynamic way.In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of Semantic Web technologies. You will learn how to represent knowledge and how to access and benefit from semantic data on the Web.SyllabusWeek 1:Introduction to the Semantic WebWeek 2:Identifying Things with URI and RDFWeek 3:Querying RDF(S) with SPARQLExcursus:Semantic (Meta) Data and the WebWeek 4:Knowledge Representation IWeek 5:Knowledge Representation IIWeek 6:Applications in the Web of DataFinal Exams:Final Exams",

The course includes video lectures and demos with in-video quizzes to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, a wide variety of automatically-checked interactive programming exercises, midterm and final exams, a discussion forum, optional additional exercises with solutions, and pointers to readings and resources. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the curriculum draws from Stanford's popular Introduction to Databases course.WHY LEARN ABOUT DATABASESDatabases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge fraction of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.PREREQUISITES:The course does not assume prior knowledge of any specific topics, however a solid computer science foundation -- a reasonable amount of programming, as well as knowledge of basic computer science theory -- will make the material more accessible.

If you don&rsquo;t know Python but have experience with another language, you should be able to pick up the syntax fairly quickly. If you have no programming experience, you should consider taking Udacity&rsquo;s&nbsp;Introduction to Computer Science&nbsp;course before attempting this one.The math used will be centered on probability and linear algebra. You don&rsquo;t need to be an expert in either, but some familiarity with concepts in probability (e.g. probabilities must add to one, conditional probability, and Bayes&rsquo; rule) will be extremely helpful. It is possible to learn these concepts during the course, but it will take more work. Knowledge of linear algebra, while helpful, is not required.See the&nbsp;Technology Requirements&nbsp;for using Udacity.SyllabusLesson 1: LocalizationLocalizationTotal Probabilit",

Developers and the software industry are used to applications becoming faster by merely exchanging the underlying hardware. However, since the beginning of the century it has become apparent that this approach no longer works.Moore's law about the ever-increasing number of transistors per chip is still valid, but power consumption, thermal management and memory latency issues are making make serial code acceleration increasingly harder. Instead, hardware vendors now use additional transistors for multiple processing elements (&lsquo;cores&rsquo;) per processor chip and deeper memory hierarchies. Modern hardware has the capability to transform any desktop, server, or even mobile system into some kind of parallel computer. This makes parallel programming the new default for application development. The exploitation of any additional horsepower from hardware is now in the responsibility of the software.The openHPI online course &ldquo;Parallel Programming Concepts&rdquo; presents relevant theoretical and practical foundations for parallel programming. We show crucial theoretical ideas such as semaphores and actors, the architecture of modern parallel hardware, different programming models such as task parallelism, message passing and functional programming, and several patterns and best practices.The course is suitable for all participants who are interested in getting a broader overview of parallelism, especially beyond the usage of multiple threads.

Though the term is often confused with User Interface, UI is only only a tiny subset of UX (we&rsquo;ll talk about the difference in Lesson 1).This is a UX design course built for current (and aspiring) mobile developers. In this short course, you'll step back from your IDE and dive into the techniques that great designers use to plan and prototype amazing apps before any code is written.Why Take This Course?You should take this course because well-designed apps are just as important as well-built apps.The goal of this course is to help you understand the most important and immediately-useful techniques and approaches used by great mobile UX designers. This course won&rsquo;t turn you into a designer, but it will help you incorporate design elements into the products you build.Prerequisites and RequirementsThis course is optimized for the developer who is looking to efficiently learn the most important design techniques that will help them make better apps (with a focus on mobile/Android).That said, programming experience is not required to benefit from the design principles and best practices we teach in this course.OverviewThe goal of this course is to help you build better apps by helping you become a design-minded developer. In Lessons 1 and 2, you will learn widely applicable design principles and techniques like high-level UX planning and user-centered design.In Lessons 3 and 4, you will focus on design ideas specific to mobile/Android development. Mobile platforms all come with a unique set of constraints and opportunities and this lesson will help you respect those constraints while taking advantage of the opportunities.SyllabusLESSON 1: WHAT IS USER EXPERIENCE?In this lesson you will think about User Experience from the highest level. You will break down complex apps into a small number of simple steps and think about their big picture flow (including ones that you have worked on in the past or are currently working on).T",

And more importantly - you will learn how to harness the power of&nbsp;App Engine&nbsp;- Platform as a Service, run by Google, so you can focus on your application's features, not on managing infrastructure that runs your app. Let Google run and scale the infrastructure and do what you do best - write code!However, to use App Engine effectively, you have to learn how it works, and this is exactly what this course will teach! You will also learn the best practices of using&nbsp;Cloud Endpoints&nbsp;that allow you to easily create RESTful services and make them accessible to iOS, Android and Javascript clients. They allow you to automatically generate client libraries to make wiring up the frontend easy. And there are some nifty built-in features, like denial-of-service protection and OAuth 2.0 support.Why Take This Course?Cloud computing is one of the fastest growing fields right now. And no wonder - it provides an easy and affordable way to run your applications. However, the traditional way of hosting and scaling applications on Virtual Machines in the Cloud comes with a cost - even if the infrastructure is virtual, you still have to manage it - do load balancing, bring instances up and down, take care of patching your software and in general spend a lot of your time and resources on just the infrastructure.Google is one of the pioneers in the business of scaling, and now you can use their infrastructure, and let them do all the scaling work so that you can focus on the unique features you app provides.ProjectThere will be an overarching project throughout the course, starting from Lesson 2. You will develop an application for organising conferences, similar to sites like meetup.com or eventbrite.com.

Besides plain texts, especially multimedia information such as graphics, audio or video have become a predominant part of the web's information traffic. But, how can we find useful information within this huge information space? How can we make use of the knowledge contained in those web documents? Traditional search engines for example will reach the limits of their power, when it comes to understanding information content. The Semantic Web is an extension of the traditional web in the sense that information in the form of natural language text in the web will be complemented by its explicit semantics based on a formal knowledge representation. Thus, the meaning of information expressed in natural language can be accessed in an automated way and interpreted correctly, i.e. it can be &lsquo;understood&rsquo; by machines.Semantic Web technologies enable the explicit representation of knowledge and its further processing to deduce new knowledge from implicitly hidden knowledge. Thus, information access and information search will be more precise and more complete compared to today's traditional information retrieval technology. Previously heterogeneous data can be mapped and combined based on common knowledge representation and schemata easily extended in a dynamic way.In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of Semantic Web technologies and how they are applied for knowledge representation in the World Wide Web.

Usually HTML and CSS is taught with a focus on language syntax. But knowing syntax alone does not enable you to create a webpage from a design. You need to know where to start and how to approach the task, in other words - you need to learn how to think like a front-end developer.In this course you will learn how to convert digital design mockups into static web pages. We will teach you how to approach page layout, how to break down a design mockup into page elements, and how to implement that in HTML and CSS.You will also learn about responsive design techniques, which are increasingly important in a world where mobile devices and TV screens are used more and more often to look for information and entertainment.Why Take This Course?Front-end Web Developers must have a fundamental understanding of HTML and CSS which we&rsquo;ll accomplish in this course by converting digital design mockups into static web pages.

They may also be adapted/interwoven with existing courses that have related topics, e.g., tech electives, office-suite applications, business skills, etc. We hope that adding MyCS to those classes will help them bridge important application-specific skills with the skillset and mindset that comes with composing computing oneself.We believe that every middle-years student should be able to confidently say that \u201cCS is something that people like me can do,\u201d and that the smartest way to reach those students is through the instructors who know them best. We hope to continue to empower teachers of all backgrounds to bring computational thinking to their classrooms.",

Software is increasingly the vehicle that drives our economy and our personal lives. But software\u2019s pervasiveness, and its importance, make it a target: at the root of many security compromises is vulnerable software.In this course we will look at how to build software that is secure.To start, we must know what we are up against. As such, we will examine the most prevalent software design and implementation defects.&nbsp;We will examine vulnerabilities like buffer overruns and use-after-frees that are present in programs written in low-level programming languages like C and C++, and see how these vulnerabilities can be exploited by a clever attacker. We will also look attacks on applications that are part of the worldwide web -- attacks with names like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and session hijacking. We will also mention side-channel attacks (such as those based on the size of messages or the time taken to process a request), attacks on the human user (like phishing), and failures of design (like the use of insecure defaults). Examples of these attacks will be taken from the headlines.Having examined these defects and their role in security compromises, we will look at how to prevent them entirely, or mitigate their effects, by improving the software's design and implementation. We will see that security must appear at all phases in the development lifecycle, including requirements development, system design, implementation, and testing/validation.Finally, we will look at state-of-the-art tools and techniques for testing and otherwise verifying that software is secure. We will consider how security testing differs from functional testing (it's harder!).

Second, the Unity game engine is very popular with indie game\ndevelopers, and C# is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity\nenvironment. And finally, C# is a really good language for learning how to\nprogram.That learning how to program\ncomment is important because this course doesn't assume you have any previous programming\nexperience. Don't worry if you've never written code before; we'll start at the\nvery beginning and work our way up to building a small, complete game by the\nend of the course. Throughout the course you'll learn core programming concepts\nthat apply to lots of programming languages, including C#, and you'll also\nlearn how to apply those concepts when you develop games: drawing all the\nentities in the game world, updating the game world based on user input and\nsimple physics, playing music and sound effects in your games, and so on.Computer programming is really fun in general,\nand programming games is even better!SyllabusWeek One: Introduction to the course, the Visual Studio environment, and the Microsoft XNA framework.

We will learn the importance of carefully defining security; of relying on a set of well-studied \u201chardness assumptions\u201d (e.g., the hardness of factoring large numbers); and of the possibility of proving security of complicated constructions based on low-level primitives. We will not only cover these ideas in theory, but will also explore their real-world impact. You will learn about cryptographic primitives in wide use today, and see how these can be combined to develop modern protocols for secure communication.SyllabusIntroduction and MotivationClassical Encryption SchemesPrinciples of Modern CryptographyPerfect Secrecy and Its LimitationsPrivate-Key EncryptionComputational SecurityPseudorandom Generators and Stream CiphersPseudorandom Functions and Block CiphersModes of EncryptionSecurity against Chosen-Ciphertext Attacks and Padding-Oracle AttacksMessage AuthenticationSecrecy vs. IntegrityMessage Authentication CodesCBC-MACAuthenticated EncryptionHash FunctionsSecurity RequirementsHMACAdditional Applications of Hash FunctionsNumber Theory and Mathematical BackgroundThe Public-Key RevolutionKey Distribution and Key ManagementDiffie-Hellman Key ExchangePublic-Key EncryptionDefinitions of SecurityHybrid Encryption and the KEM/DEM ParadigmEl Gamal Encryption and DHIESRSA Encryption and t",

But just like astronomy is more than simply using telescopes, Computer Science is more than simply using computers. It\u2019s about programming computers to tell them precisely what to do. Coding is an invaluable skill that helps people think computationally, and hence effectively solve problems within and outside computer science. It is also creative and fun, allowing you, for instance, to build computer games to play with your friends.This course will introduce you to computer programming withScratch, one of the easiest to use programming languages. You will create computer programs by plugging graphical coding blocks together, for example to create animations, build games and construct interactive stories.But this course is much more than an introduction to Scratch. It will teach you how to think like a programmer, a computer scientist, a software engineer! It will introduce you to the fundamental principles of computing, and prompt you to think around topics like algorithm design, user interaction, code reusability and generalisation of solutions.You will learn all this through in-depth, hands-on examples, interviews with computing experts, fun quizzes and creative projects. By the end of this course you will be equipped with a solid understanding of the foundations of computing, allowing you to move to different programming languages or take a more advanced programming course in the future.NOTE: This course is also given in Spanish:&nbsp;https://www.coursera.org/course/aprogramarSyllabusWeek 1: Your first computer programWeek 2: Code gone loopyWeek 3: Remixing gamesWeek 4: Reusing your codeWeek 5: Think like a software engineer",

We will learn Sorting, Searching, Indexing, as well as their applications thoroughly. More detailed, these chapters include a variety of classic Sorting algorithms (Quicksort, External Sorting), Searching methods (Sets, Hash Tables, Bitmaps), Indexing structures (B/B+ trees, Trie trees), Advanced List-Structure (generalized lists, Multi-dimensional arrays) and Balanced Binary Trees (AVL, Red-Black trees, Splay trees). After studying this course, students will be well prepared for further study and research in engineering and other computer-related areas.Syllabus&nbsp;\u7b2c\u4e00\u5468&nbsp;\u5185\u6392\u5e8f\uff08\u4e0a\uff09Lecture 1 Internal Sorting I\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\u6392\u5e8f\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6982\u5ff5&nbsp;The Basic Concept of Sorting\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f ( Shell \u6392\u5e8f)&nbsp;Insertion Sort (Shell Sort)\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f (\u5806\u6392\u5e8f)&nbsp;Selection Sort (Heap Sort)\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\u4ea4\u6362\u6392\u5e8f\uff08\u5192\u6ce1\u6392\u5e8f\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u6392\u5e8f\uff09Exchange Sort (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort)\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5468&nbsp;\u5185\u6392\u5e8f\uff08\u4e0b\uff09Lecture 2 Internal Sorting II\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\u5f52\u5e76\u6392\u5e8f&nbsp;Merge Sort\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\u6876\u6392\u5e8f&nbsp;&nbsp;Bin Sort\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u6570\u6392\u5e8f&nbsp;&nbsp;Static Radix Sort\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\u94fe\u5f0f\u57fa\u6570\u6392\u5e8f&nbsp;&nbsp;Linked Radix Sort\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\u7d22\u5f15\u6392\u5e8f&nbsp;&nbsp;Indexing Sort\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4ee3\u4ef7&nbsp;&nbsp;The Complexity of Sorting\u7b2c\u4e09\u5468&nbsp;\u6587\u4ef6\u4e0e\u5916\u6392\u5e8f&nbsp;Lecture 3 File and External Sort\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\u4e3b\u5b58\u3001\u5916\u5b58\u3001\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7&nbsp;Main Memory, External Memory and File\u2019s Architecture\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\u5916\u6392\u5e8f&nbsp;External Sort\u7b2c\u56db\u5468&nbsp;\u68c0\u7d22&nbsp;Lecture 4 Searching\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u6982\u5ff5&nbsp;The Concept of Searching\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u7684\u68c0\u7d22&nbsp;&nbsp;Linear Searching\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u68c0\u7d22&nbsp;&nbsp;Set-based Searching\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\u6563\u5217\u8868\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u6563\u5217\u51fd\u6570&nbsp;The Con",

We will introduce Linear Lists, Stacks, Queues, Strings, Binary Trees, Trees and Graphs, which are fundamental data structures. Students will learn how to organize data efficiently and make tradeoffs between space and time complexity, design efficient and effective algorithms, and implement high quality programs to solve complex real-world problems.&nbsp;Syllabus\u7b2c\u4e00\u5468 &nbsp;\u6982\u8bba Week 1 Overview\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3&nbsp; Solving\nProblems\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u62bd\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b Data\nStructures and Abstract Data Types\u7b97\u6cd5\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5206\u7c7b The\nProperties and Categories of Algorithm\u7b97\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5ea6\u91cf\n&nbsp;Evaluating Efficiency of Algorithm&nbsp;\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5468&nbsp;\u7ebf\u6027\u8868&nbsp;Week 2 Linear Lists\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784 The Structure\nof Lists\u987a\u5e8f\u8868 Sequential\nLists\u94fe\u8868 Linked Lists\u987a\u5e8f\u8868\u548c\u94fe\u8868\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83 The\nComparison of Sequential Lists and Linked Lists\u7b2c\u4e09\u5468 \u6808\u4e0e\u961f\u5217&nbsp;Week 3 Stack and\nQueue\u6808 Stacks\u6808\u4e0e\u9012\u5f52 Stacks and\nRecursion\u9012\u5f52\u8f6c\u975e\u9012\u5f52\uff08\u9009\u4fee\uff09 Implementation of Recursion using Stacks (Optional)\u961f\u5217 Queues &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\u961f\u5217\u7684\u5e94\u7528 The\nApplication of Queues\u7b2c\u56db\u5468&nbsp;\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32 Week 4 Strings\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u57fa\u672c\u6982\u5ff5&nbsp;The Basic\nConcept of Strings\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u7ed3\u6784&nbsp;The\nStorage Structure of Strings\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u8fd0\u7b97\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0&nbsp;The Implementation\nof Strings\u2019 Operations\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\uff08\u9009\u4fee\uff09&nbsp;KMP Fast String Matching (Optional)&nbsp;\u7b2c\u4e94\u5468&nbsp;\u4e8c\u53c9\u6811\uff08\u4e0a\uff09Week 5&nbsp;Binary Trees I\u4e8c\u53c9\u6811\u7684\u6982\u5ff5&nbsp;The Basic\nConcept of Binary Trees\u4e8c\u53c9\u6811\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b&nbsp;The\nAbstract Data Type for a Binary Tree\u4e8c\u53c9\u6811\u7684\u641c\u7d22 &nbsp;Binary Tree Traversals\u4e8c\u53c9\u6811\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u7ed3\u6784&nbsp;The Storage\nStructures for Binary Trees\u7b2c\u516d\u5468&nbsp;\u4e8c\u53c9\u6811\uff08\u4e0b\uff09Week 6 Binary Trees\nII\u4e8c\u53c9\u641c\u7d22\u6811 &nbsp;Binary\nSearch Trees\u5806\u4e0e\u4f18\u5148\u961f\u5217&nbsp;Heaps\nand Priority QueuesHuffman\u6811\u53ca\u5176\u5e94\u7528&nbsp;&nbsp;Huffman Coding Trees and Its Application &nbsp;\u7b2c\u4e03\u5468&nbsp;\u6811&nbsp",

You will learn about data collection, description, analysis and interpretation in qualitative research. The qualitative approach often involves an iterative process. We will focus on the basic ingredients required for this process: data collection and analysis. A good qualitative analysis consists of a general strategy of analysis, clear analytic 'actions' and documentation of all the steps taken. An important analytical action is coding parts of the material. This forms the basis for the categorisation and interpretation of the data. In this course you will learn to use statistical software to perform the qualitative analysis. We will also discuss and compare different types of analysis and interpretation. The most important concepts in qualitative analysis will be discussed in light of these different types.SyllabusThe qualitative approach to empirical science has its own origin story and is associated with a different philosophy of science than the quantitative approach.

If you pick up a machine learning textbook you may find it forbiddingly mathematical, but in this class you will learn that the key ideas and algorithms are in fact quite intuitive. And powerful!Most of the class will be devoted to supervised learning (in other words, learning in which a teacher provides the learner with the correct answers at training time). This is the most mature and widely used type of machine learning. We will cover the main supervised learning techniques, including decision trees, rules, instances, Bayesian techniques, neural networks, model ensembles, and support vector machines. We will also touch on learning theory with an emphasis on its practical uses. Finally, we will cover the two main classes of unsupervised learning methods: clustering and dimensionality reduction. Throughout the class there will be an emphasis not just on individual algorithms but on ideas that cut across them and tips for making them work.In the class projects you will build your own implementations of machine learning algorithms and apply them to problems like spam filtering, clickstream mining, recommender systems, and computational biology.

While many new techniques are being designed every day, some techniques stood the test of time and became popular tools nowadays.The course roughly corresponds to the second \nhalf-semester of the National Taiwan University course \"Machine \nLearning.\" Based \non five years of teaching this popular course successfully (including \nwinning the most prestigious teaching award of National Taiwan \nUniversity) and discussing with many other scholars actively, the \ninstructor chooses to focus on three of those popular tools, namely embedding numerous features (kernel models, such as support vector machine), combining predictive features (aggregation models, such as adaptive boosting), and distilling hidden features (extraction models, such as deep learning).SyllabusEach of the following items correspond to approximately one hour of video lecture.[\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7684\u6bcf\u500b\u5c0f\u9805\u76ee\u5c0d\u61c9\u5230\u7d04\u4e00\u5c0f\u6642\u7684\u7dda\u4e0a\u8ab2\u7a0b]Embedding Numerous Features[\u5d4c\u5165\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u7279\u5fb5]-- Linear Support Vector Machine[\u7dda\u6027\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u6a5f]-- Dual Support Vector Machine[\u5c0d\u5076\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u6a5f]-- Kernel Support Vector Machine[\u6838\u578b\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u6a5f]-- Soft-Margin Support Vector Machine[\u8edf\u5f0f\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u6a5f]-- Kernel Logistic Regression[\u6838\u578b\u7f85\u5409\u65af\u8ff4\u6b78]-- Support Vector Regression[\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u8ff4\u6b78]Combining Predictive Features[\u878d\u5408\u9810\u6e2c\u6027\u7684\u7279\u5fb5]-- Bootstrap Aggre",

More people have access to cell phones today than to clean water.Mobile communication and computing technologies have much potential to contribute to human development. This is already felt in some measure in learning. There are reports of new advantages and benefits in key other sectors such as agriculture and food production and rural credit and finance. This course is about important concepts and practices in mobile technologies that are relevant to learning and education, agricultural extension and rural credit and finance.",
