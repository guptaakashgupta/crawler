        "description": "The Butte Laboratory builds and applies tools that convert more than 400 trillion points of molecular, clinical, and epidemiological data -- measured by researchers and clinicians over the past decade -- into diagnostics, therapeutics, and new insights into disease. Examples of this method includes work on cancer drug discovery published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (2000), on type 2 diabetes published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (2003 and 2012), on fat cell formation published in Nature Cell Biology (2005), on obesity in Bioinformatics (2007), and in transplantation published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (2009).  To facilitate this, the Butte Lab has developed tools to automatically index and find genomic data sets based on the phenotypic and contextual details of each experiment, published in Nature Biotechnology (2006), to re-map microarray data, published in Nature Methods (2007), to deconvolve multi-cellular samples, published in Nature Methods (2010), and to perform these calculations on the internet \"cloud\", as published in Nature Biotechnology (2010).  The Butte Lab has used these tools on publicly-available molecular data to successfully find and validate new uses for existing drugs, as published in back-to-back papers in Science Translational Medicine (2011) and Cancer Discovery (2013). The Butte Lab has also been developing novel methods in comparing clinical data from electronic health record systems with gene expression data, as described in Science (2008), and was part of the team performing the first clinical annotation of a patient presenting with a whole genome, as described in the Lancet (2010).",

Founded in 2008 by director Ge Wang and students, faculty, and staff at Stanford University's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA), this unique ensemble comprises more than 20 laptops, human performers, controllers, and custom multi-channel speaker arrays designed to provide each computer meta-instrument with its own identity and presence. The orchestra fuses a powerful sea of sound with the immediacy of human music-making, capturing the irreplaceable energy of a live ensemble performance as well as its sonic intimacy and grandeur. At the same time, it leverages the computer's precision, possibilities for new sounds, and potential for fantastical automation to provide a boundary-less sonic canvas on which to experiment, create, and perform music. \r\n\r\nOffstage, the ensemble serves as a one-of-a-kind learning environment that explores music, human-computer interaction, design, composition, and live performance in a naturally interdisciplinary way (it's also a cross-listed course in Music and Computer Science). SLOrk uses the ChucK programming language as its primary software platform for sound synthesis/analysis, instrument design, performance, and education.",

It was predictable because the major advances for memory devices involved scaling down the physical dimensions of essentially the same device structure using basically the same materials. The situation has changed in the last decade. Memory devices are beginning to be difficult to scale down. But perhaps the most important change is that new applications and products (e.g. mobile phones, tablets, enterprise-scale disk storage) in the last decade are often enabled by advances in memory technology, in particular solid-state non-volatile memories.\r\n\r\nOur research on memory devices focuses on phase change memory(PCM)and metal oxide resistive switching memory(RRAM). We work on understanding the fundamental physics of these devices and develop models of how they work. We explore the use of various materials and device structures (e.g. 3D vertical RRAM) to achieve desired characteristics. We often utilize the unique properties of nanoscale materials such as carbon nanotube, graphene, and nanoparticles to help us gain understanding of the physics and scaling properties of memory devices.",

Whereas machine learning is a very successful technology, applying it today still often requires spending substantial effort hand-designing features to feed to the algorithm. This is true for applications in vision, audio, and text/NLP. To address this, Ng's group and others are working on \"deep learning\" algorithms, which can automatically learn feature representations (often from unlabeled data), thus bypassing most of this time-consuming engineering. These algorithms are based on building massive artificial neural networks, that were loosely inspired by cortical (brain) computations.  One our group's most celebrated results in deep learning is a highly distributed neural network with over 1 billion parameters trained on 16,000 CPU cores (at Google), and that learned by itself to discover high level concepts--such as \"cats\"---from watching unlabeled YouTube video. \r\nFor a high-level overview of the field, see the followingvideo.",

We propose a fully automatic learning framework that is able to learn robust scene models from noisy web data such as images and user tags from Flickr.com. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by automatically classifying, annotating and segmenting images from eight classes depicting sport scenes.

Stanley finished in just under 6 hours 54 minutes and averaged over 19 miles per hours on the course. \r\n\r\nThe Grand Challenge, first held in March 2004, is an off-road robot competition devised by DARPA to promote research in the area of autonomous vehicles. The challenge, in general terms, is to build a robot capable of navigating without human intervention over 130 miles of rough terrain in less than 10 hours.\r\n\r\nCalling this task a Grand Challenge is not an exaggeration! The 2004 course started in Barstow, California (1.5 hours outside of Los Angeles) and ended in Primm, Nevada. The most successful competitor navigated only 7.5 miles out of the 142 mile course.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to visitwww.stanfordracing.orgto check on our progress!",

        "description": "Since 1996, research on light fields has followed a number of lines. On the theoretical side, researchers have developed spatial and frequency domain analyses of light field sampling and have proposed several new parameterizations of the light field, including surface light fields and unstructured Lumigraphs. On the practical side, researchers have experimented with literally dozens of ways to capture light fields, ranging from camera arrays to kaleidoscopes, as well as several ways to display them, such as an array of video projectors aimed at a lenticular sheet.\r\n\r\nResearchers have also explored the relationship between light fields and other sampled representations of light transport, such as incident light fields and reflectance fields. At Stanford, we have focused on the boundary between light fields, photography, and high-performance imaging, an area we sometimes call computational photography. However, our research also touches on other aspects of light fields, such as interactive animation of light fields and computing shape from light fields.",

        "description": "The Common Password Problem.Users tend to use a single password at many different web sites. By now there are several reported cases where attackers breaks into a low security site to retrieve thousands of username/password pairs and directly try them one by one at a high security e-commerce site such as eBay. As expected, this attack is remarkably effective.A Simple Solution.PwdHash is a browser extension that transparently converts a user's password into a domain-specific password. The user can activate this hashing by choosing passwords that start with a special prefix (@@) or by pressing a special password key (F2). PwdHash automatically replaces the contents of these password fields with a one-way hash of the pair (password, domain-name). As a result, the site only sees a domain-specific hash of the password, as opposed to the password itself. A break-in at a low security site exposes password hashes rather than an actual password. We emphasize that the hash function we use is public and can be computed on any machine which enables users to login to their web accounts from any machine in the world. Hashing is done using a Pseudo Random Function (PRF).Phishing protection.A major benefit of PwdHash is that it provides a defense against password phishing scams. In a phishing scam, users are directed to a spoof web site where they are asked to enter their username and password. SpoofGuard is a browser extension that alerts the user when a phishing page is encountered. PwdHash complements SpoofGuard in defending users from phishng scams: using PwdHash the phisher only sees a hash of the password specific to the domain hosting the spoof page. This hash is useless at the site that the phisher intended to spoof.",

        "description": "Volumetric models of facial musculature enable highly realistic computer simulations of visual speech and expressive face motion. This research addresses the performance, control and analysis challenges that arise from the simulation of such high detail models and caters to both computer graphics and medical applications.\r\n\r\nRealistic simulation and analysis of facial expressions is an open research problem with a wide range of potential applications such as special effects, communications, visual speech synthesis and maxillofacial medicine. The goals of visual realism and biophysical accuracy suggest a clear advantage for simulation methods that respect the anatomy of the face by modeling the tissue composition of the flesh and employ the underlying musculature as the driving force behind the formation of expressions.\r\n\r\nThis project involves the development of novel algorithms for increasing the computational performance of high resolution face models by several orders of magnitude, enhancing the quality of all visual elements involved in the simulation and providing convenient, intuitive and efficient ways of controlling the motion of the face, for example using easy to obtain motion capture data.",

As a result, concern about the ownership, control, privacy, and accuracy of these data has become a top priority. This project focuses on both the technical challenges of handling sensitive data and the policy and legal issues facing data subjects, data owners, and data users.",
